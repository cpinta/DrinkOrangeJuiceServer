        "summary": "An alcoholic beverage (also called an adult beverage, alcoholic drink, strong drink, or simply a drink) is a drink that contains ethanol, a type of alcohol and is produced by fermentation of grains, fruits, or other sources of sugar. The consumption of alcoholic drinks, often referred to as \"drinking\", plays an important social role in many cultures. Alcoholic drinks are typically divided into three classes\u2014beers, wines, and spirits\u2014and typically their alcohol content is between 3% and 50%.\n\nMost countries have laws regulating the production, sale, and consumption of alcoholic beverages, and the temperance movement advocates against the consumption of alcoholic beverages. Regulations may require the labeling of the percentage alcohol content (as ABV or proof) and the use of a warning label. Some countries ban the consumption of alcoholic drinks, but they are legal in most parts of the world. The global alcoholic drink industry exceeded $1.5 trillion in 2017.Alcohol is one of the most widely used recreational drugs in the world, and about 33% of all humans currently drink alcohol. In 2015, among Americans, 86% of adults had consumed alcohol at some point, with 70% drinking it in the last year and 56% in the last month. Several other animals are affected by alcohol similarly to humans and, once they consume it, will consume it again if given the opportunity, though humans are the only species known to produce alcoholic drinks intentionally.Alcohol is a depressant, which in low doses causes euphoria, reduces anxiety, and increases sociability. In higher doses, it causes drunkenness, stupor, unconsciousness, or death. Long-term use can lead to an alcohol use disorder, an increased risk of developing several types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and physical dependence. According to the World Health Organization, alcohol is in the highest risk-group carcinogen, and no quantity of its consumption can be considered safe.",

        "summary": "Ayahuasca is a South American psychoactive brew, traditionally used by Indigenous cultures and folk healers in the Amazon and Orinoco basins for spiritual ceremonies, divination, and healing a variety of psychosomatic complaints. Originally restricted to areas of Peru, Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador, in the middle of 20th century it became widespread in Brazil in context of appearance of syncretic religions that use ayahuasca as a sacrament, like Santo Daime, Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal and Barquinha, which blend elements of Amazonian Shamanism, Christianity, Kardecist Spiritism,  and African-Brazilian religions such as Umbanda, Candombl\u00e9 and Tambor de Mina, later expanding to several countries across all continents, notably the United States and Western Europe, and, more incipiently, in Eastern Europe, South Africa, Australia, and Japan.More recently, new phenomena regarding ayahuasca use have evolved and moved to urban centers in North America and Europe, with the emergence of neoshamanic hybrid rituals and spiritual and recreational drug tourism. Also, anecdotal evidence, studies conducted among ayahuasca consumers and clinical trials suggest that ayahuasca has broad therapeutic potential, especially for the treatment of substance dependence, anxiety, and mood disorders. Thus, currently, despite continuing to be used in a traditional way, ayahuasca is also consumed recreationally worldwide, as well as used in modern medicine.\nAyahuasca is commonly made by the prolonged decoction of the stems of the Banisteriopsis caapi vine and the leaves of the Psychotria viridis shrub, although hundreds of species are used in addition or substitution (See \"Preparation\" below). P. viridis contains N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a highly psychedelic substance, although orally inactive, B. caapi is rich with harmala alkaloids, such as harmine, harmaline and tetrahydroharmine (THH), which can act as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOi). This halts liver and gastrointestinal metabolism of DMT, allowing it to reach the systemic circulation and the brain, where it activates 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors in frontal and paralimbic areas.",

        "summary": "A caffeinated drink, or caffeinated beverage, is a drink that contains caffeine, a stimulant that is legal practically all over the world. Some are naturally caffeinated while others have caffeine added as an ingredient.\nThe most common naturally caffeinated beverages are coffee and tea, which in one form or another (usually served hot, but sometimes iced) feature in most world cultures. Other drinks are artificially caffeinated as part of their production process. These include certain soft drinks (primarily cola drinks), and also energy drinks designed as a stimulant, and to perpetuate activity at times when the user might ordinarily be asleep.\nThe consumption of caffeinated drinks is often intended entirely or partly for the physical and mental effects of caffeine. Examples include the consumption of tea or coffee with breakfast in many westernized societies, in order to 'wake oneself up', or the deliberate consumption of energy drinks by students wishing to study through the night, or revellers seeking to maintain an alert attitude during social recreation. Caffeine can cause a physical dependence, if consumed in excessive amounts. The need for caffeine can be identified when individuals feel headaches, fatigue and muscle pain 24 hours after their last energy drink.Some commercially distributed drinks contain guarana, a South American berry with a caffeine content about twice that of coffee beans.Many caffeinated drinks also have decaffeinated counterparts, for those who enjoy the taste, but wish to limit their caffeine intake because of its physical effects, or due to religious or medical perceptions of the drug and its effects.\nIn recent years, some alcoholic beverage companies have begun to manufacture caffeinated alcoholic beverages. The manufacturing of such beverages has been met with much controversy.Beverages containing caffeine include coffee, tea, soft drinks (\"colas\"), energy drinks, other beverages. According to a 2020 study in the United States, coffee is the major source of caffeine intake in middle-aged adults, while soft drinks and tea are the major sources in adolescents. Energy drinks are more commonly consumed as a source of caffeine in adolescents as compared to adults.",

        "summary": "Cannabis tea (also known as weed tea, pot tea, ganja tea or a cannabis decoction) is a cannabis-infused drink prepared by steeping various parts of the cannabis plant in hot or cold water. Cannabis tea is commonly recognized as an alternative form of preparation and consumption of the cannabis plant, more popularly known as marijuana, pot, or weed. This plant has long been recognized as an herbal medicine employed by health professionals worldwide to ease symptoms of disease, as well as a psychoactive drug used recreationally and in spiritual traditions. Though less commonly practiced than popular methods like smoking or consuming edibles, drinking cannabis tea can produce comparable physical and mental therapeutic effects. Such effects are largely attributed to the THC and CBD content of the tea, levels of which are drastically dependent on individual preparation techniques involving volume, amount of cannabis, and boiling time. Also in common with these administration forms of cannabis is the heating component performed before usage. Due to the rather uncommon nature of this particular practice of cannabis consumption in modern times (in contrast to historical use) as well as the legality of cannabis throughout the World, the research available on the composition of cannabis tea is limited and based broadly around what is known of cannabis as it exists botanically.",

One popular brand was Vin Mariani, developed in 1863 by French-Corsican chemist and entrepreneur Angelo Mariani.At the end of the 19th century, the fear of drug abuse made coca-based drinks less popular. This led to the prohibition of cocaine in the United States in 1914 via the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act, and the removal of cocaine from coca wine, though coca leaf remained. Coca wine itself became illegal in the United States when its other main drug, alcohol, was banned just a few years later with the Eighteenth Amendment in 1920.",

One claimant to the introduction and increased popularity of Italian sodas is Torani: Rinaldo and Ezilda Torre brought recipes for flavored syrups from Lucca, Italy, and in 1925 introduced what became known as an Italian soda to the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco, California. The Italian-American association with Italian sodas has been reinforced by various ready-made brands of Italian sodas, such as the 2005 creation of Romano's Italian Soda Company (named after the Italian-American grandfather of the company's founder) and the 2007 introduction of \"The Sopranos Old Fashioned Italian Sodas\" which come in three flavors: limoncello, amaretto, and Chianti.",

        "summary": "Although viticulture and the cultivation of grapes for table consumption has a long history in Japan, domestic wine production using locally produced grapes only really began with the adoption of Western culture during the Meiji restoration in the second half of the 19th century.\nAccording to data from Japan's National Tax Agency for 2017, approximately 382,000 kiloliters of wine was purchased in Japan, of which two-thirds was imported wine. Of the 102,000 kiloliters of wine domestically produced that year, only a fifth came from domestically grown and harvested grapes. The Agency states the share of Japanese wine, as defined as domestically produced wine from domestically grown grapes, as only 4% of total domestic consumption, or 14,988 kiloliters. Only 58 kiloliters of Japanese wine was exported overseas.The main region for winemaking in Japan is in Yamanashi Prefecture which accounts for approximately a third of domestic production, although grapes are cultivated and wine is also produced in more limited quantities by vintners throughout the country, from Hokkaido in the North to Miyazaki Prefecture on the Southern island of Kyushu.",

In wines, it parallels the hierarchical systems of France (1935) and Italy (1963), although Rioja (1925) and Jerez (1933) preceded the full system. In foods, it performs a similar role, regulation of quality and geographical origin of products from Spain. There are five other designated categories solely for wine and a further three specifically covering food and condiments, all recognised by the European Union (EU). In Catalonia, two further categories \u2013 labelled A and Q \u2013 cover traditional Catalan artisan food products, but were not recognised by the EU as of 2007. In recent decades, the concept of the denominaci\u00f3n de origen has been adopted by other countries, primarily in Latin America. In 2016, the use of the Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen (DO) for wines was registered as a European Union Protected Designations of Origin/Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen Protegida (PDO/DOP), but the traditional Portuguese term of DO can still be used legally on labels.",

        "summary": "French wine is produced all throughout France, in quantities between 50 and 60 million hectolitres per year, or 7\u20138 billion bottles. France is one of the largest wine producers in the world, along with Italian, Spanish, and American wine-producing regions. French wine traces its history to the 6th century BCE, with many of France's regions dating their wine-making history to Roman times. The wines produced range from expensive wines sold internationally to modest wines usually only seen within France such as the Margnat wines of the post war period.\nTwo concepts central to the better French wines are the notion of terroir, which links the style of the wines to the locations where the grapes are grown and the wine is made, and the Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC) system, replaced by the Appellation d'Origine Prot\u00e9g\u00e9e (AOP) system in 2012. Appellation rules closely define which grape varieties and winemaking practices are approved for classification in each of France's several hundred geographically defined appellations, which can cover regions, villages or vineyards.\nFrance is the source of many grape varieties (such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Sauvignon blanc, Syrah) that are now planted throughout the world, as well as wine-making practices and styles of wine that have been adopted in other producing countries. Although some producers have benefited in recent years from rising prices and increased demand for prestige wines from Burgundy and Bordeaux, competition from New World wines has contributed to a decline in the domestic and international consumption of French wine.",

Access to international markets led to new investment in the South African wine market. Production is concentrated around Cape Town and almost exclusively located within the Western Cape province, with major vineyard and production centres at Constantia, Paarl, Stellenbosch and Worcester.\nThere are about 60 appellations within the Wine of Origin (WO) system, which was implemented in 1973 with a hierarchy of designated production regions, districts and wards. WO wines must only contain grapes from the specific area of origin. \"Single vineyard\" wines must come from a defined area of less than 6 hectares. An \"Estate Wine\" can come from adjacent farms if they are farmed together and wine is produced on site. A ward is an area with a distinctive soil type or climate and is roughly equivalent to a European appellation.",

        "summary": "Alcohol, sometimes referred to by the chemical name ethanol, is a depressant drug that is the active ingredient in fermented drinks such as beer, wine, and distilled spirits (hard liquor). It is one of the oldest and most commonly consumed recreational drugs, causing the characteristic effects of alcohol intoxication (\"drunkenness\"). Among other effects, alcohol produces happiness and euphoria, decreased anxiety, increased sociability, sedation, impairment of cognitive, memory, motor, and sensory function, and generalized depression of central nervous system (CNS) function.\nEthanol is only one of several types of alcohol; other alcohols such as methanol and isopropyl alcohol are significantly more toxic. A mild, brief exposure to isopropyl alcohol (which is only moderately more toxic than ethanol) is unlikely to cause any serious harm, but methanol is lethal even in small quantities, as little as 10\u201315 milliliters (2\u20133 teaspoons). However, several analogues that naturally occur as psychoactive alcohols in alcoholic drinks are less toxic than ethanol. Unlike primary alcohols like ethanol, tertiary alcohols cannot be oxidized into aldehyde or carboxylic acid metabolites, which are often toxic. For example, the tertiary alcohol 2M2B is 20 times more potent than ethanol, and has been used recreationally.\nAlcohol has a variety of short-term and long-term adverse effects. Short-term adverse effects include generalized impairment of neurocognitive function, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and hangover-like symptoms. Alcohol is addictive to humans, and can result in alcohol use disorder, dependence and withdrawal. It can have a variety of long-term adverse effects on health, such as liver and brain damage, and its consumption can cause cancer. The adverse effects of alcohol on health are most important when it is used in excessive quantities or with heavy frequency. However, some of them, such as increased risk of certain cancers, may occur even with light or moderate alcohol consumption. In high amounts, alcohol may cause loss of consciousness or, in severe cases, death. In 2021, there were 2,627 deaths in the US due to alcohol poisoning.Alcohol works in the brain primarily by increasing the effects of \u03b3-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain; by facilitating GABA's actions, alcohol suppresses the activity of the CNS. The substance also directly affects a number of other neurotransmitter systems including those of glutamate, glycine, acetylcholine, and serotonin. The pleasurable effects of alcohol ingestion are the result of increased levels of dopamine and endogenous opioids in the reward pathways of the brain. Alcohol also has toxic and unpleasant actions in the body, many of which are mediated by its byproduct acetaldehyde.",

The drink is made on the rocks in a tall glass, such as a Collins glass, with a jigger of singani and filled with either ginger ale, 7-Up, or Sprite and often garnished with a slice of lime. Chuflay is used in special events, i.e. weddings, promotions, etc. This drink is very affordable in most places and is served frequently.\nThis new combination of singani and ginger ale was called \"short fly\", a term that in railway slang gives its name to \"a temporary rail, usually built around a flooded area, a breakdown or other obstacle\". The term used by the English engineers was \"Short Fly\", a railroad term used to refer to shortcuts, and it was called that way because the drink made them drunk quickly. When the Bolivians heard \"Short Fly\" they transformed it into \"Chuflay \"\nThis analogy was due to the fact that singani was a temporary replacement for the gin shortage. The name was later Spanishized as \"chuflay\" by the local populations that came into contact with this drink, which gradually became an emblematic Bolivian beverage.\nIt is commonly associated with the dice game called cacho. It is consumed in several regions of Bolivia, such as the departments of La Paz, Potos\u00ed, Oruro, Cochabamba, Chuquisaca, Santa Cruz and Tarija.",

        "summary": "Liquor ( LIK-\u0259r) is an alcoholic drink produced by the distillation of grains, fruits, vegetables, or sugar that have already gone through alcoholic fermentation. Other terms for liquor include: spirit, distilled beverage, spirituous liquor or hard liquor. The distillation process concentrates the liquid to increase its alcohol by volume. As liquors contain significantly more alcohol (ethanol) than other alcoholic drinks, they are considered \"harder.\" In North America, the term hard liquor is sometimes used to distinguish distilled alcoholic drinks from non-distilled ones, whereas the term spirits is more commonly used in the UK. Some examples of liquors include vodka, rum, gin, and tequila. Liquors are often aged in barrels, such as for the production of brandy and whiskey, or are infused with flavorings to form flavored liquors, such as absinthe.\nWhile the word liquor ordinarily refers to distilled alcoholic spirits rather than beverages produced by fermentation alone, it can sometimes be used more broadly to refer to any alcoholic beverage (or even non-alcoholic products of distillation or various other liquids).Like other alcoholic drinks, liquor is typically consumed for the psychoactive effects of alcohol. Liquor may be consumed on its own (\"neat\"), typically in amounts of around 50 millilitres (1.7 US fluid ounces) per served drink. In an undiluted form, distilled beverages are often slightly sweet and bitter and typically impart a burning mouthfeel with an odor derived from the alcohol and the production and aging processes; the exact flavor varies between different varieties of liquor and the different impurities they impart. Liquor is also frequently mixed with other ingredients to form a cocktail.\nRapid consumption of a large amount of liquor can cause severe alcohol intoxication or alcohol poisoning, which can be fatal. Consistent consumption of liquor over time correlates with higher mortality and other harmful health effects, even when compared to other alcoholic beverages.",

        "summary": "A pisco sour is an alcoholic cocktail of Peruvian and Chilean origin that is traditional to both Peruvian cuisine and Chilean cuisine. The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term sour, about sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lime juice, simple syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and Pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves.\nAlthough the preparation of pisco-based mixed beverages possibly dates back to the 1700s, historians and drink experts agree that the cocktail as it is known today was invented in the early 1920s in Lima, the capital of Peru, by the American bartender Victor Vaughen Morris. Morris left the United States in 1903 to work in Cerro de Pasco, a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris' Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are found in newspaper and magazine advertisements, dating to the early 1920s, for Morris and his bar published in Peru and Chile. The pisco sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris' Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe for the cocktail in the latter part of the 1920s by adding Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix.\nCocktail connoisseurs consider the pisco sour a South American classic. Chile and Peru both claim the pisco sour as their national drink, and each asserts ownership of the cocktail's base liquor\u2014pisco; consequently, the pisco sour has become a significant and oft-debated topic of Latin American popular culture. Media sources and celebrities commenting on the dispute often express their preference for one cocktail version over the other, sometimes just to cause controversy. Some pisco producers have noted that the controversy helps promote interest in the drink. The two kinds of pisco and the two variations in the style of preparing the pisco sour are distinct in both production and taste. Peru celebrates yearly in honor of the cocktail on the first Saturday of February.",

        "summary": "Singani is a Bolivian eau-de-vie or brandy distilled from white Muscat of Alexandria grapes. Only produced in the high valleys of Bolivia, it is the country's national distilled spirit and considered part of its cultural patrimony.\nSingani has been produced since the 16th century shortly after the Spanish arrived in South America.  It was first distilled by monastic orders who needing sacramental wine found it expedient to also distill.  Most sources say the name singani derives from a pre-Columbian village of that name near the mission that first distilled the liquor. While its production methods and drinking characteristics more closely resemble eaux-de-vie, it is treated as a brandy for purposes of international trade. It has since been declared a Domain of Origin (Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen or DO) and a Geographical Indication (GI) by the Bolivian government.\nSince the 1990s, formal Bolivian regulations have codified what has long been practiced, and the vineyards from which singani is made are to be planted at elevations of 1,600 m (5,250 feet) or higher.  Singani is thereby known as an altitude product in Bolivian legal terms, the official phrase \"of altitude\" being also applied to Bolivian wines and grapevine cultivars.  Although there are vineyards at elevations much higher than the official minimum, they are difficult to manage, and most production comes from plantations at around 1,800 m (6,000 feet) above sea level close to where the wineries and distillation facilities are located.",

The late 20th century saw a renewed focus on the development of Vitis vinifera with the assistance of flying winemakers from regions like Australia.

Any confusion when one is visiting different parts of the country can easily be solved by explicitly asking for either \"hot tea\" or \"iced tea.\" Afternoon tea, as a meal, is rarely served in the U.S. except in ritualized special occasions such as the tea party or an afternoon out at a high-end hotel or restaurant, which may also offer cream tea on their menu.",

Touched by the display of courage and love, the monk buried the rooster and from that spot, the bai ji guan tea bush grew.Unlike most Wuyi teas, the leaves of this tea are yellowish to light green rather than dark green or brown.\nThe flavour is also quite different from the other Wuyi oolongs, which tend to be otherwise very similar as a group. Like most Wuyi oolongs, it sits in the highly oxidized end of the oolong tea spectrum, though in the lower range of oxidization for a Wuyi tea, which tend to be 60-80% oxidized.",

Black tea is generally stronger in flavour than other teas. All five types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree) Camellia sinensis, though Camellia taliensis is also used rarely.Two principal varieties of the species are used \u2013 the small-leaved Chinese variety plant (C. sinensis var. sinensis), used for most other types of teas, and the large-leaved Assamese plant (C. sinensis var. assamica), which was traditionally mainly used for black tea, although in recent years some green and white teas have been produced. \nFirst originating in China, the beverage's name there is hong cha (Chinese: \u7d05\u8336, \"red tea\") due to the color of the oxidized leaves when processed appropriately. Today, the drink is widespread throughout East and Southeast Asia, both in consumption and harvesting, including in China, Japan, Korea and Singapore. Similar variants are also available in South Asian countries.\nWhile green tea usually loses its flavour within a year, black tea retains its flavour for several years. For this reason, it has long been an article of trade, and compressed bricks of black tea even served as a form of de facto currency in Mongolia, Tibet and Siberia well into the 19th century.",

It has evolved since the Portuguese colonial period to include imported varieties and tea-drinking customs. \nThere is a popular belief in Brazil that Brazilians, especially the urban ones, have a greater taste for using sugar in teas than in other cultures, being unused to unsweetened drinks.\nDuring the colonial era, imported tea varieties were first cultivated in Brazil in 1812. Throughout the 19th century, the tea industry, much like the coffee industry, was heavily dependent on slave labor to work on the plantations. \nWhen slavery was abolished in 1888, the tea trade collapsed. In the 1920s, the tea industry was revived by Japanese immigrants, who introduced tea seeds from Sri Lanka and India. Prior to this time, only Chinese tea varieties had been grown in Brazil.Brazil's largest tea-producing region is near Registro, a coastal city near S\u00e3o Paulo. Registro is in the Brazilian Highlands and forms a terrain of low rolling hills that are ideal for mechanized tea production. The growing season in Brazil is from September to April; the climate is hot and humid. \nThe relatively low altitude of most of Brazil's tea plantations, however, produces a tea which is less flavorful than high altitude teas. For this reason, Brazilian teas are most often produced for blending. The tea is used for both iced tea and hot tea blends with about 70% of the total tea production being sold to the United States.",

Taiwanese immigrants brought it to the United States in the 1990s, initially in California through regions including Los Angeles County, but the drink has also spread to other countries where there is a large East Asian diaspora population.\nBubble tea most commonly consists of tea accompanied by chewy tapioca balls (\"boba\" or \"pearls\"), but it can be made with other toppings as well, such as grass jelly, aloe vera, red bean, and popping boba. It has many varieties and flavors, but the two most popular varieties are pearl black milk tea and pearl green milk tea (\"pearl\" for the tapioca balls at the bottom).",

        "summary": "Builder's tea, also known as a builder's brew or gaffer's tea, is a British English colloquial term for a strong cup of tea. It takes its name from the inexpensive tea commonly drunk by labourers taking a break. A builder's tea is typically brewed in a mug with the tea contained in a teabag (as opposed to loose leaves in a teapot), with a small amount of milk usually added after either stirring the tea or leaving it to stand and infuse. It is often taken with one or more teaspoons of white sugar, but this is optional.\nBuilder's tea is typically robust and has a rich, dark beige colour. The name was chosen because workers in the British building trade typically drink many cups of tea during their working day. The term has widespread use throughout both Great Britain and Ireland. Research from the Social Issues Research Centre found that people performing construction work found tea \"both soothing and stimulating\".A 2013 article in the Daily Express noted that building workers are drinking less tea than they used to, preferring alternatives such as coffee, cappuccinos and lattes, as well as soft drinks.",

In Chinese tradition, once a pot of chrysanthemum tea has been drunk, hot water is typically added again to the flowers in the pot (producing a tea that is slightly less strong); this process is often repeated several times.To prepare the tea, chrysanthemum flowers (usually dried) are steeped in hot water (usually 90 to 95 degrees Celsius after cooling from a boil) in either a teapot, cup, or glass; often rock sugar or cane sugar is also added. The resulting drink is transparent and ranges from pale to bright yellow in color, with a floral aroma.",

        "summary": "Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks.The seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff\u00e8 latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often added to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.\nThough coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it is now prepared for drinking. The coffee beans were procured by the Yemenis from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries, and cultivated in Yemen. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe.\nThe two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C. robusta. Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa. As of 2023, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing 35% of the world's total. Green, unroasted coffee is traded as an agricultural commodity. Despite sales of coffee reaching billions of dollars worldwide, farmers producing coffee beans disproportionately live in poverty. Critics of the coffee industry have also pointed to its negative impact on the environment and the clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use. The global coffee industry is massive and worth $495.50 billion as of 2023. Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia are the top exporters of coffee beans as of 2023.",

        "summary": "Genmaicha (\u7384\u7c73\u8336, \"brown rice tea\") is a Japanese brown rice green tea consisting of green tea mixed with roasted popped brown rice. It is sometimes referred to colloquially as \"popcorn tea\" because a few grains of the rice pop during the roasting process and resemble popcorn, or as \"people's tea\", as the rice served as a filler and reduced the price of the tea, making it historically more available for poorer Japanese. Today all segments of society drink genmaicha. It was also used by people fasting for religious purposes or who found themselves to be between meals for long periods of time.\nThe sugar and starch from the rice cause the tea to have a warm, full, nutty flavor. It is considered easy to drink and to make the stomach feel better. \nTea steeped from genmaicha has a light yellow hue. Its flavor is mild and combines the fresh grassy flavor of green tea with the aroma of the roasted rice.\nGenmaicha is also sold with matcha (powdered green tea) added to it. This product is called matcha-iri genmaicha (\u62b9\u8336\u5165\u308a\u7384\u7c73\u8336) (lit. genmaicha with added powdered tea). Matcha-iri genmaicha has a similar flavor to plain genmaicha, but the flavor is often stronger and the color more green than light yellow.In South Korea, a very similar tea is called hyeonminokcha (\ud604\ubbf8\ub179\ucc28; \"brown rice green tea\"), while the word hyeonmicha (\ud604\ubbf8\ucc28), which is a cognate of genmaicha, refers to an infusion of roasted brown rice in boiling water.",

It is one of the most popular blended teas, common in tea culture in Ireland.

However, throughout the mid-19th century, Irish breakfast tea became readily available to those of both lower and higher socioeconomic classes.",

It originates from Taiwan. The taste is light, creamy, and flowery and sometimes compared to milk. This tea variety can be grown at higher altitudes, and the yield is about 20% higher compared to traditional tea varieties. These circumstances made it one of the most popular varieties among tea farmers in Taiwan and Thailand. While genuine Jin Xuan naturally tastes milky, some producers produce artificial Jin Xuan through additives.Contrary to myth, the flavoring of the leaves to accentuate their characteristic buttery taste is not obtained through steeping or steaming them in milk before roasting. Given that this quality is varietally endemic to the tea, the taste enhancement is simply produced by extra oxidization. Reputable dealers usually declare whether it is a natural or flavored oolong. A flavored Jin Xuan can be recognized before the tea is steeped. The added flavors mask the natural tea flavor significantly.",

        "summary": "Kombucha (also tea mushroom, tea fungus, or Manchurian mushroom when referring to the culture; Latin name Medusomyces gisevii) is a fermented, lightly effervescent, sweetened black tea drink. Sometimes the beverage is called kombucha tea to distinguish it from the culture of bacteria and yeast. Juice, spices, fruit or other flavorings are often added.\nKombucha is thought to have originated in China, where the drink is traditional. By the early 20th century it spread to Russia, then other parts of Eastern Europe and Germany. Kombucha is now homebrewed globally, and also bottled and sold commercially. The global kombucha market was worth approximately US$1.7\u2009billion as of 2019.Kombucha is produced by symbiotic fermentation of sugared tea using a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY) commonly called a \"mother\" or \"mushroom\". The microbial populations in a SCOBY vary. The yeast component generally includes Saccharomyces cerevisiae, along with other species; the bacterial component almost always includes Gluconacetobacter xylinus to oxidize yeast-produced alcohols to acetic acid (and other acids). Although the SCOBY is commonly called \"tea fungus\" or \"mushroom\", it is actually \"a symbiotic growth of acetic acid bacteria and osmophilic yeast species in a zoogleal mat [biofilm]\". The living bacteria are said to be probiotic, one of the reasons for the popularity of the drink.Numerous health benefits have been claimed to correlate with drinking kombucha; there is little evidence to support any of these claims. The beverage has caused rare serious adverse effects, possibly arising from contamination during home preparation. It is not recommended for therapeutic purposes.",

Its consumption has spread throughout North Africa, parts of the Sahel, France, Spain, the Arab world, and Middle East. \nMint tea is central to social life in the Maghreb. and is very popular among the Tuareg people of Algeria, Libya, Niger and Mali. The serving can take a ceremonial form, especially when prepared for a guest. The tea is traditionally made by the head male in the family and offered to guests as a sign of hospitality. Typically, at least three glasses of tea are served. The tea is consumed throughout the day as a social activity. The native spearmint na\u02bfn\u0101\u02bf (\u0646\u0639\u0646\u0627\u0639) possesses a clear, pungent, mild aroma, and is the mint that is traditionally used in Maghrebi mint tea. Other hybrids and cultivars of spearmint, including yerba buena, are occasionally used as substitutes for Nana mint. In Morocco, mint tea is sometimes perfumed with herbs, flowers, or orange blossom water. In the cold season, they add many warming herbs like pennyroyal mint and wormwood. Mint has been used as an infusion, decoction, and herbal medicine throughout the Mediterranean since Antiquity. This aromatic plant was widely used in Algeria to cure and prevent cholera when it plagued the country from 1835 until 1865.",

Sweet tea is almost always served ice cold. It may sometimes be flavored, most commonly with lemon but also with peach, raspberry, or mint. The drink is sometimes tempered with baking soda to reduce its acidity. Although sweet tea may be brewed with a lower sugar and calorie content than most fruit juices and sodas, it is not unusual to find sweet tea with a sugar level as high as 22 degrees Brix, or 22 g per 100 g of liquid, a level twice that of Coca-Cola.Sweet tea is regarded as an important regional staple in the cuisine of the Southern United States and Indonesia.  The availability of sweet tea in restaurants and other establishments is popularly used as an indicator to gauge whether an area can be considered part of the South.",

        "summary": "Tea (\u8336, cha) is an important part of Japanese culture. It first appeared in the Nara period (710\u2013794), introduced to the archipelago by ambassadors returning from China, but its real development came later, from the end of the 12th century, when its consumption spread to Zen temples, also following China's example; it was then powdered tea that was drunk after being beaten (called matcha today). In the Middle Ages, tea became a common drink for the elite, and in the 16th century, the art of the \"tea ceremony\" was formalized. It is now one of the most emblematic elements of Japanese culture, whose influence extends beyond the simple context of tea drinking. Tea-growing developed in the pre-modern era, particularly during the Edo period (1603\u20131868), when tea became a popular beverage consumed by all strata of society. New ways of processing and consuming tea leaves were developed, starting with sencha, a steamed oxidation-stopped brew that became the most common.\nToday a handful of prefectures share the cultivation of tea plantations (Shizuoka, Kagoshima, Mie), whose mostly mechanically picked leaves are used to produce green teas, primarily sencha, but also lesser-known varieties such as bancha, or more elaborate varieties like gyokuro. Certain terroirs have a long-standing reputation for producing quality teas, first and foremost Uji in the Kyoto Prefecture. With an annual production of around 80,000 tonnes, Japan is still not a major tea producer on a global scale, nor is it a major exporter or even importer, since it consumes most of its own production. Tea leaves are now mainly used to make tea drinks sold in plastic bottles, a fast-moving consumer product that has become popular in society in the 2010s and is available in many variants. From the mid-2000s onwards, tea consumption supplanted that of loose leaves, while at the same time, other beverages such as coffee and soft drinks have overtaken tea in Japanese household spending. Tea consumption is also being renewed by the development of new products and increased use of matcha tea powder in gastronomy.\nTea has long enjoyed great importance in Japanese culture, which has adopted many elements of Chinese tea culture, but has also added its own, starting with the tea ceremony, which conquered the milieu of the medieval elites, then was promoted in modern times as one of the characteristic elements of traditional Japanese culture, and is presented as such on tourist sites and at diplomatic events. It has given rise to a specific aesthetic, concerning both the places where the ceremony is held and the objects used, which are the object of great attention both in their design and in their use, thus contributing to the \"cult of the object\" typical of Japanese aesthetics.",

Turkey has the highest per capita tea consumption in the world with an annual total consumption of over 3 kilograms per person. Turkey is a large exporter of tea, ranking fifth among the top exporting countries. Tea plays a big role in social gatherings that take place in tea houses and gardens. It is also used as a herbal medicine. Turkish tea culture extends to Northern Cyprus and some countries in the Balkan Peninsula. Turkish tea has a long and expansive history that shaped its harvesting even before the founding of the modern Turkish Republic.

        "summary": "A tea strainer is a type of strainer that is placed over or in a teacup to catch loose tea leaves.\nWhen tea is brewed in the traditional manner in a teapot, the tea leaves are not contained in teabags; rather, they are freely suspended in the water. As the leaves themselves are not consumed with the tea, it is usual to filter them out with a tea strainer. Strainers usually fit into the top of the cup to catch the leaves as the tea is poured.\nSome deeper tea strainers can also be used to brew single cups of tea, much as teabags or brewing baskets are used \u2013  the strainer full of leaves is set in a cup to brew the tea. It is then removed, along with the spent tea leaves, when the tea is ready to drink. By using a tea strainer in this way, the same leaves can be used to brew multiple cups.\nDespite the fact that tea strainer use has declined in the 20th century with mass production of the tea bag, it is still preferred among connoisseurs, who claim that keeping the leaves packed in a bag, rather than freely circulating, inhibits diffusion. Many assert that inferior ingredients, namely dust-quality tea, are often used in tea bags.\nTea strainers are usually either sterling silver, stainless steel, or china. Strainers often come in a set, with the strainer itself and a small saucer for it to rest on between cups. Tea strainers themselves have often been turned into artistic masterpieces of the silver- and goldsmith's craft, as well as rarer specimens of fine porcelain.\nBrewing baskets (or infusing baskets) resemble tea strainers, but are more typically put in the top of a teapot to keep the tea leaves contained during brewing. There is no definitive boundary between a brewing basket and a tea strainer, and the same tool might be used for both purposes.",

        "summary": "A  teacup is a cup for drinking tea. It generally has a small handle that may be grasped with the thumb and one or two fingers. It is typically made of a ceramic material and is often part of a set which is composed of a cup and a matching saucer or a trio that includes a small cake or sandwich plate. These may be part of a tea set combined with a teapot, cream jug, covered sugar bowl, and slop bowl.  Teacups are often wider and shorter than coffee cups. Cups for morning tea are conventionally larger than cups for afternoon tea.\nHigher quality teacups are typically made of fine white translucent porcelain and decorated with patterns. Some collectors acquire numerous one-of-a-kind cups with matching saucers. Such decorative cups may be souvenirs of a location, person, or event.\nIn Europe, fine porcelain tea cups, such as French Limoges porcelain from a kaolin base heated in ovens or Chinese porcelain, were a luxury for enjoying tea time. These cups are made with a handle and are paired with a saucer in a set and often feature hand painted decoration and gold or silver patterns, especially lining the rim and the handle.\nIn the Chinese culture teacups are very small and hold between 20 and 50 ml of liquid. They are designed to be used with Yixing teapots or Gaiwan. In Russian-speaking and West Asian cultures influenced by the Ottoman Empire tea is often served in a Faceted glass held in a separate metal container with a handle, called a zarf in Turkish and Arabic, the podstakannik being its Russian cousin.",

        "summary": "Absinthe (, French: [aps\u025b\u0303t] ) is an anise-flavored spirit derived from several plants, including the flowers and leaves of Artemisia absinthium (\"grand wormwood\"), together with green anise, sweet fennel, and other medicinal and culinary herbs. Historically described as a highly alcoholic spirit, it is 45\u201374% ABV or 90\u2013148 proof in the US. Absinthe traditionally has a natural green color but may also be colorless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as la f\u00e9e verte (\"the green fairy\"). It is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur, but is not traditionally bottled with added sugar, so is classified as a spirit. Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water before being consumed.\nAbsinthe was created in the canton of Neuch\u00e2tel in Switzerland in the late 18th century by the French doctor Pierre Ordinaire. It rose to great popularity as an alcoholic drink in late 19th- and early 20th-century France, particularly among Parisian artists and writers. The consumption of absinthe was opposed by social conservatives and prohibitionists, partly due to its association with bohemian culture. From Europe and the Americas, notable absinthe drinkers included Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Lewis Carroll, Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.Absinthe has often been portrayed as a dangerously addictive psychoactive drug and hallucinogen. The chemical compound thujone, which is present in the spirit in trace amounts, was blamed for its alleged harmful effects. By 1915, absinthe had been banned in the United States and in much of Europe, including France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and Austria-Hungary, yet it has not been demonstrated to be any more dangerous than ordinary spirits. Recent studies have shown that absinthe's psychoactive properties (apart from those attributable to alcohol) have been exaggerated.A revival of absinthe began in the 1990s, following the adoption of modern European Union food and beverage laws that removed long-standing barriers to its production and sale. By the early 21st century, nearly 200 brands of absinthe were being produced in a dozen countries, most notably in France, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and the Czech Republic.",

        "summary": "Amaro (Italian for \"bitter\") is an Italian herbal liqueur that is commonly consumed as an after-dinner digestif. It usually has a bitter-sweet flavour, sometimes syrupy, and has an alcohol content between 16% and 40%.\nSimilar liqueurs have traditionally been produced throughout Europe. There are local varieties in Germany (where they are called Kr\u00e4uterlik\u00f6r), Hungary, the Netherlands, and France. But the term amaro is applied only to Italian products of this kind.\nAmaro is typically produced by macerating herbs, roots, flowers, bark, and/or citrus peels in alcohol, either neutral spirits or wine, mixing the filtrate with sugar syrup, and allowing the mixture to age in casks or bottles.\nDozens of varieties are commercially produced, the most commonly available of which are Fernet Branca, Averna, Ramazzotti, Lucano, and Montenegro.\nMany commercial bottlers trace their recipe or production to the 19th century. Recipes often originated in monasteries or pharmacies.\nAmaro is typically drunk neat, sometimes with a citrus wedge. It may also be drunk on ice, with tonic water or cola-flavoured sodas, as it's commonly and peculiarly done in the country of Argentina.",

        "summary": "A bar, also known as a saloon, a tavern  or tippling house, or sometimes as a pub or club, is an establishment retail business that serves alcoholic beverages, such as beer, wine, liquor, cocktails, and other beverages such as mineral water and soft drinks. Bars often also sell snack foods, such as crisps or peanuts, for consumption on their premises. Some types of bars, such as pubs, may also serve food from a restaurant menu. The term \"bar\" refers to the countertop where drinks are prepared and served, and by extension to the overall premises.\nThe term derives from the metal or wooden bar (barrier) that is often located along the length of the \"bar\". Over many years, heights of bars were lowered, and high stools added, and the brass bar remains today.\nBars provide stools or chairs that are placed at tables or counters for their patrons. Bars that offer entertainment or live music are often referred to as \"music bars\", \"live venues\", or \"nightclubs\". Types of bars range from inexpensive dive bars\nto elegant places of entertainment, often accompanying restaurants for dining.\nMany bars operate a discount period, designated a \"happy hour\" or discount of the day to encourage off-peak-time patronage. Bars that fill to capacity sometimes implement a cover charge or a minimum drink-purchase requirement during their peak hours. Bars may have bouncers to ensure that patrons are of legal age, to eject drunk or belligerent patrons, and to collect cover charges. Such bars often feature entertainment, which may be a live band, vocalist, comedian, or disc jockey playing recorded music.\nPatrons may sit or stand at the counter and be served by a bartender. Depending on the size of a bar and its approach, alcohol may be served at the bar by bartenders, at tables by servers, or by a combination of the two. The \"back bar\" is a set of shelves of glasses and bottles behind the counter. In some establishments, the back bar is elaborately decorated with woodwork, etched glass, mirrors, and lights.",

        "summary": "Beer is an alcoholic drink produced by the brewing and fermentation of starches from cereal grains\u2014most commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), rice, and oats are also used. The fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation. Most beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and act as a preservative and stabilising agent. Other flavouring agents, such as gruit, herbs, or fruits, may also be used. In commercial brewing, natural carbonation is often replaced with forced carbonation.Some of the earliest writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating it, and \"The Hymn to Ninkasi\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, a recipe for it.Beer is distributed in bottles and cans and is also commonly available on draught, particularly in pubs and bars. The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. The strength of beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume (ABV).Beer forms part of the culture of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals, as well as activities like pub crawling, pub quizzes, and pub games.",

        "summary": "Carbonated water (also known as soda water, bubbly water, sparkling water, fizzy water, club soda, water with gas, in many places as mineral water, or especially in the United States as seltzer or seltzer water) is water containing dissolved carbon dioxide gas, either artificially injected under pressure or occurring due to natural geological processes. Carbonation causes small bubbles to form, giving the water an effervescent quality. Common forms include sparkling natural mineral water, club soda, and commercially produced sparkling water.Club soda and sparkling mineral water and some other sparkling waters contain added or dissolved minerals such as potassium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, or potassium sulfate. These occur naturally in some mineral waters but are also commonly added artificially to manufactured waters to mimic a natural flavor profile and offset the acidity of introducing carbon dioxide gas giving one a fizzy sensation. Various carbonated waters are sold in bottles and cans, with some also produced on demand by commercial carbonation systems in bars and restaurants, or made at home using a carbon dioxide cartridge.It is thought that the first person to aerate water with carbon dioxide was William Brownrigg in the 1740s. Joseph Priestley invented carbonated water, independently and by accident, in 1767 when he discovered a method of infusing water with carbon dioxide after having suspended a bowl of water above a beer vat at a brewery in Leeds, Yorkshire. He wrote of the \"peculiar satisfaction\" he found in drinking it, and in 1772 he published a paper entitled Impregnating Water with Fixed Air. Priestley's apparatus, almost identical to that used by Henry Cavendish five years earlier, which featured a bladder between the generator and the absorption tank to regulate the flow of carbon dioxide, was soon joined by a wide range of others. However, it was not until 1781 that carbonated water began being produced on a large scale with the establishment of companies specialized in producing artificial mineral water. The first factory was built by Thomas Henry of Manchester, England. Henry replaced the bladder in Priestley's system with large bellows.While Priestley's discovery ultimately led to the creation of the soft drink industry\u2014which began in 1783 when Johann Jacob Schweppe founded Schweppes to sell bottled soda water\u2014although he did not benefit financially from his invention. Priestley received scientific recognition when the Council of the Royal Society \"were moved to reward its discoverer with the Copley Medal\" at the anniversary meeting of the Royal Society on 30 November 1773.",

        "summary": "Cider ( SY-d\u0259r) is an alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juice of apples. Cider is widely available in the United Kingdom (particularly in the West Country) and the Republic of Ireland. The UK has the world's highest per capita consumption, as well as the largest cider-producing companies. Ciders from the South West of England are generally higher in alcoholic content. Cider is also popular in many Commonwealth countries, such as India, South Africa, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. As well as the UK and its former colonies, cider is popular in Portugal (mainly in Minho and Madeira), France (particularly Normandy and Brittany), Friuli, and northern Spain (specifically  Asturias and Basque Country). Germany also has its own types of cider with Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse producing a particularly tart version known as Apfelwein. In the U.S. and Canada, varieties of alcoholic cider are often called hard cider to distinguish it from non-alcoholic apple cider or \"sweet cider\", also made from apples. In Canada, cider cannot contain less than 2.5% or over 13% absolute alcohol by volume.The juice of most varieties of apple, including crab apples, can be used to make cider, but cider apples are best. The addition of sugar or extra fruit before a second fermentation increases the ethanol content of the resulting beverage. Cider alcohol content varies from 1.2% to 8.5% ABV or more in traditional English ciders, and 3.5% to 12% in continental ciders. In UK law, it must contain at least 35% apple juice (fresh or from concentrate), although CAMRA (the Campaign for Real Ale) says that \"real cider\" must be at least 90% fresh apple juice. In the US, there is a 50% minimum. In France, cider must be made solely from apples.In 2014, a study found that a 1-US-pint (470 ml) bottle of mass-market cider contained five teaspoons (20.5 g) of sugar, nearly the amount the WHO recommends as an adult's daily allowance of added sugar, and 5\u201310 times the amount of sugar in lager or ale.Perry is a similar product to cider made by fermenting pear juice. When distilled, cider turns into fruit brandy.",

The opacity and rich taste of coconut milk are due to its high oil content, most of which is saturated fat. Coconut milk is a traditional food ingredient used in Southeast Asia, Oceania, South Asia, and East Africa. It is also used for cooking in the Caribbean, tropical Latin America, and West Africa, where coconuts were introduced during the colonial era.\nCoconut milk is differentiated into subtypes based on fat content. They can be generalized into coconut cream (or thick coconut milk) with the highest amount of fat; coconut milk (or thin coconut milk) with a maximum of around 20% fat; and coconut skim milk with negligible amounts of fat. This terminology is not always followed in commercial coconut milk sold in Western countries.Coconut milk can also be used to produce milk substitutes (differentiated as \"coconut milk beverages\"). These products are not the same as regular coconut milk products which are meant for cooking, not drinking. A sweetened, processed, coconut milk product from Puerto Rico is also known as cream of coconut. It is used in many desserts and beverages like the pi\u00f1a colada, though it should not be confused with coconut cream.",

Among the specified grapes, Ugni blanc, known locally as Saint-\u00c9milion, is most widely used. The brandy must be twice distilled in copper pot stills and aged at least two years in French oak barrels from Limousin or Tron\u00e7ais. Cognac matures in the same way as whiskies and wines barrel-age, and most cognacs spend considerably longer \"on the wood\" than the minimum legal requirement.",

Cola became popular worldwide after the American pharmacist John Stith Pemberton invented Coca-Cola, a trademarked brand, in 1886, which was imitated by other manufacturers. Most colas originally contained caffeine from the kola nut (Cola acuminata), leading to the drink's name, though other sources of caffeine are generally used in modern formulations. The Pemberton cola drink also contained a coca plant extract. His non-alcoholic recipe was inspired by the coca wine of pharmacist Angelo Mariani, created in 1863.Most modern colas have a dark  caramel color and are sweetened with sugar and/or high-fructose corn syrup. They come in numerous different brands, with Coca-Cola and Pepsi being among the most popular. These two companies have been competing since the 1890s, a rivalry that has intensified since the 1980s.",

The renaissance spanned from the early 2000s into the late 2010s. A stricter range is 2004 to 2017: by 2017, high-quality ingredients, techniques, and liquors began to be ubiquitous in bars across the United States, leading writers to declare the renaissance over.",

It is available commercially in a colorless version (called \"white\") and a green version (colored by the mint leaves or by added coloring if made from extract instead of leaves).  Both varieties have similar flavor and are interchangeable in recipes, except where color is important. It is usually made with Corsican mint or peppermint, which is steeped in grain alcohol for several weeks before it is filtered and sweetened to create the final product. It typically has 25% alcohol by volume.\nCr\u00e8me de menthe is an ingredient in several cocktails, such as the Grasshopper and the Stinger. It is also served as a digestif and used in cooking as a flavoring (see Mint chocolate). It is also a primary component of the popular South African shooter known as the Springbokkie.",

The taste profile and aroma are distinctly floral and sweet, and reminiscent of the violet candies popular in the early to mid 20th century.  Its known production dates back to the early 19th century when it was served with dry vermouth or alone as a cordial.\nAfter cr\u00e8me de violette had been all but unavailable in the United States for decades, in mid-2007 Haus Alpenz began importing the Rothman & Winter Cr\u00e8me de Violette, which is made from Queen Charlotte and March violet flowers from the Alps. Since then, other brands of cr\u00e8me de violette have arrived on the US market, e.g., The Bitter Truth from Europe.\nCr\u00e8me de violette is the forerunner to the liqueurs Parfait d'Amour and the American variation, Creme Yvette, both of which are decidedly different with pronounced vanilla and/or citrus flavors.  When cr\u00e8me de violette is not available it is possible to use the Parfait Amour or creme Yvette to replicate the violet color in a drink, though the taste profile is quite different.It is considered a core ingredient in the Aviation cocktail.The rarity of cr\u00e8me de violette appeared as a plot element in an episode of The Avengers in 1965 entitled \"Two's A Crowd\".",

        "summary": "Fernet (Italian pronunciation: [fer\u02c8n\u025bt]) is an Italian type of amaro, a bitter, aromatic spirit. Fernet is made from a number of herbs and spices which vary according to the brand, but usually include myrrh, rhubarb, chamomile, cardamom, aloe, and especially saffron, with a base of distilled grape spirits.\nFernet is usually served as a digestif after a meal but may also be served with coffee and espresso or mixed into coffee and espresso drinks. It typically contains 45% alcohol by volume. It may be served at room temperature or with ice.\nThe Italian liqueur has a cult following in the international bartending community and is immensely popular in Argentina. The South American country consumes more than 75% of all fernet produced globally and, due to the product's popularity, also has Fratelli Branca's only distillery outside of Italy. As it is traditionally mixed with Coke, fernet has also contributed in making Argentina one of the biggest consumers of Coca-Cola in the world. Fernet and Coke (Spanish: fernet con coca) is so ubiquitous in Argentina that it has been described as \"the country's unofficial drink\". This combination is called fernandito.",

Although typically made with Fernet-Branca and Coca-Cola, several amaro brands have appeared in Argentina since its popularization, as well as ready-to-drink versions.\nThe cocktail first became popular among the youth of the college town of C\u00f3rdoba, in the 1980s and\u2014impulsed by an advertising campaign led by Fratelli Branca\u2014its consumption grew in popularity during the following decades to become widespread throughout the country, surpassed only by that of beer and wine. It is now considered a cultural icon of Argentina and is especially associated with its home province of C\u00f3rdoba, where the drink is most consumed. The popularity of fernet con coca is such that Argentina consumes more than 75% of all fernet produced globally. The cocktail can also be found in some of its bordering countries, like Uruguay.\nIn 2020, fernet con coca became the first Argentine drink to be recognized as an IBA official cocktail, listed under the name \"fernandito\" in the \"new era drinks\" category.",

Juice emerged as a popular beverage choice after the development of pasteurization methods enabled its preservation without using fermentation (which is used in wine production). The largest fruit juice consumers are New Zealand (nearly a cup, or 8 ounces, each day) and Colombia (more than three quarters of a cup each day).

        "summary": "Gin () is a distilled alcoholic drink flavoured with juniper berries and other botanical ingredients.Gin originated as a medicinal liquor made by monks and alchemists across Europe. The modern gin was modified in Flanders and the Netherlands to provide aqua vita from distillates of grapes and grains, becoming an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Gin became popular in England after the introduction of jenever, a Dutch and Belgian liquor. Although this development had been taking place since the early 17th century, gin became widespread after the 1688 Glorious Revolution led by William of Orange and subsequent import restrictions on French brandy. Gin emerged as the national alcoholic drink of England during the so-called Gin Craze of 1695\u20131735.\nGin is produced from a wide range of herbal ingredients in a number of distinct styles and brands. After juniper, gin tends to be flavoured with herbs, spices, floral or fruit flavours, or often a combination. It is commonly mixed with tonic water in a gin and tonic. Gin is also used as a base spirit to produce flavoured, gin-based liqueurs, for example sloe gin, traditionally produced by the addition of fruit, flavourings and sugar.",

Historically it was produced by the natural fermentation of prepared ginger spice, yeast and sugar.\nCurrent ginger beers are often manufactured rather than brewed, frequently with flavour and colour additives, with artificial carbonation. Ginger ales are not brewed.\nGinger beer's origins date from the colonial spice trade with the Orient and the sugar-producing islands of the Caribbean. It was popular in Britain and its colonies from the 18th century. Other spices were variously added and any alcohol content was limited to 2% by excise tax laws in 1855. Few brewers have maintained an alcoholic product.Ginger beer is still produced at home using a symbiotic colony of yeast and a Lactobacillus (bacteria) known as a \"ginger beer plant\" or from a \"ginger bug\" starter created from fermenting ginger, sugar, and water.",

While strongly associated with the Caribbean to this day due to its Barbadian origin, rum is nowadays produced in nearly every major sugar-producing region of the world, such as the Philippines, where Tanduay Distillers, the largest producer of rum worldwide, has its headquarters.Rums are produced in various grades. Light rums are commonly used in cocktails, whereas \"golden\" and \"dark\" rums were typically consumed straight or neat, iced (\"on the rocks\"), or used for cooking, but are now commonly consumed with mixers. Premium rums are made to be consumed either straight or iced.\nRum plays a part in the culture of most islands of the West Indies as well as the Maritime provinces and Newfoundland, in Canada. The beverage has associations with the Royal Navy (where it was mixed with water or beer to make grog) and piracy (where it was consumed as bumbo). Rum has also served as a medium of economic exchange, used to help fund enterprises such as slavery (see Triangular trade), organized crime, and military insurgencies (e.g., the American Revolution and Australia's Rum Rebellion).",

Traditionally the word \"mezcal\" has been used generally in Mexico for all agave spirits and it continues to be used for many agave spirits whether these spirits have been legally certified as \"mezcal\" or not.Agaves or magueys are endemic to the Americas and found globally as ornamental plants. More than 90% of mezcal is made in the Mexican state of Oaxaca, but is now produced and commercialized throughout Mexico for the national and international market.  Native fermented drinks from maguey plant, such as pulque, existed before the arrival of the Spanish.\nThe origin of mezcal is tied to the introduction of distillation technology which was introduced to New Spain either by the Spanish or Filipino sailors.\nIn the 21st century, mezcal is still made from the heart of the agave plant, called the pi\u00f1a, in much the same way as it was 200 years ago. In Mexico, mezcal is generally consumed straight and has a strong smoky flavor. Though other types of mezcal are not as popular as tequila, Mexico does export the product, mostly to Japan and the United States, and exports are increasing as the liquor grows in popularity.Despite the similar name, mezcal does not contain mescaline or other psychedelic substances.",

        "summary": "Mojito (; Spanish: [mo\u02c8xito]) is a traditional Cuban punch. The cocktail often consists of five ingredients: white rum, sugar (traditionally sugar cane juice), lime juice, soda water, and mint. Its combination of sweetness, citrus, and herbaceous mint flavors is intended to complement the rum, and has made the mojito a popular summer drink.When preparing a mojito, fresh lime juice is added to sugar (or to simple syrup) and mint leaves. The mixture is then gently mashed with a muddler. The mint leaves should only be bruised to release the essential oils and should not be shredded. Then rum is added and the mixture is briefly stirred to dissolve the sugar and to lift the mint leaves up from the bottom for better presentation. Finally, the drink is topped with crushed ice and sparkling soda water. Mint sprigs or lime wedges are used to garnish the glass.\nIn Cuba, the mint used to make mojito is most commonly Mentha \u00d7 villosa (called yerba buena or hierbabuena in Cuba) which has a light minty/citrus aroma, but outside of Cuba spearmint, which has a stronger mint aroma, is often used.",

        "summary": "Orange bitters is a form of bitters, a cocktail flavoring made from such ingredients as the peels of Seville oranges, cardamom, caraway seed, coriander, anise, and burnt sugar in an alcohol base. Orange bitters, which are not to be confused with the standard Angostura aromatic bitters, are currently enjoying a resurgence among cocktail enthusiasts. It is to be noted that the well-known House of Angostura is one of the producers of orange bitters.For many years, it was difficult to find orange bitters in the United States and elsewhere. Because of this, some cocktail recipes that traditionally contained orange bitters may now exclude that ingredient.\nRenowned mixologist Gary Regan created Regan's Orange Bitters (stylized and trademarked as Regans') in the 1990s. Regans' is bottled and sold by the Sazerac Company, whose chief executive officer, Mark Brown, had worked with Regan to create a modern version of these bitters. Since 2006, the Bitter Truth in Germany has produced all-natural orange bitters, and there are now a number of different brands on the market.Different orange bitters are sometimes mixed to hit the desired note. For example, a \"Feegan's\", often used in a Manhattan, consists of an equal-parts mix of Fee Bros West India Orange Bitters and Regans' Orange Bitters No. 6. This is done to balance out the candy-like sweetness of Fee's and the heavy cardamom note of Regans'.Orange bitters can also be made at home, allowing one to create new flavor profiles that are not available anywhere else. The process of making orange bitters takes several days. While orange bitters are typically alcoholic, there are several brands of non-alcoholic bitters available.Drinks whose recipes can include orange bitters include the Old Fashioned, the dry martini, and the revolver.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "summary": "Orange juice is a liquid extract of the orange tree fruit, produced by squeezing or reaming oranges. It comes in several different varieties, including blood orange, navel oranges, valencia orange, clementine, and tangerine. As well as variations in oranges used, some varieties include differing amounts of juice vesicles, known as \"pulp\" in American English, and \"(juicy) bits\" in British English. These vesicles contain the juice of the orange and can be left in or removed during the manufacturing process. How juicy these vesicles are depend upon many factors, such as species, variety, and season. In American English, the beverage name is often abbreviated as \"OJ\".\nCommercial orange juice with a long shelf life is made by pasteurizing the juice and removing the oxygen from it. This removes much of the taste, necessitating the later addition of a flavor pack, generally made from orange products. Additionally, some juice is further processed by drying and later rehydrating the juice, or by concentrating the juice and later adding water to the concentrate.\nThe health value of orange juice is debatable: it has a high concentration of vitamin C, but also a very high concentration of simple sugars, comparable to soft drinks. As a result, some government nutritional advice has been adjusted to encourage substitution of orange juice with raw fruit, which is digested more slowly, and limit daily consumption.",

A more complex variant of the Paloma is the cantarito, which in addition to lime juice, also has lemon juice and orange juice.The paloma is more flavorful than its closest relative, the greyhound, which consists of grapefruit juice and either gin or vodka mixed and served over ice.\nSome believe the name of the cocktail comes from the Spanish for \"dove\", but others suspect the name comes from a derivation of the word pomelo, which is the Spanish for \"grapefruit\".",

        "summary": "A pub (short for public house) is a drinking establishment licensed to serve alcoholic drinks for consumption on the premises. The term first appeared in the late 17th century, to differentiate private houses from those open to the public as alehouses, taverns and inns. Today, there is no strict definition, but CAMRA states a pub has four characteristics:\n\nis open to the public without membership or residency\nserves draught beer or cider without requiring food be consumed\nhas at least one indoor area not laid out for meals\nallows drinks to be bought at a bar (i.e., not only table service)The history of pubs can be traced to taverns in Roman Britain, and through Anglo-Saxon alehouses, but it was not until the early 19th century that pubs, as they are today, first began to appear. The model also became popular in countries and regions of British influence, where pubs are often still considered to be an important aspect of their culture. In many places, especially in villages, pubs are the focal point of local communities. In his 17th-century diary, Samuel Pepys described the pub as \"the heart of England\".Although the drinks traditionally served include draught beer and cider, most also sell wine, spirits, tea, coffee, and soft drinks. Many pubs offer meals and snacks, and so-called gastro-pubs serve food in a manner akin to a restaurant. \nA licence is required to operate a pub and the licensee is known as the landlord or landlady, or the publican. Often colloquially referred to as their \"local\" by regular customers, pubs are typically chosen for their proximity to home or work, good food, social atmosphere, the presence of friends and acquaintances, and the availability of pub games such as darts or snooker. Pubs often screen sporting events, such as rugby, cricket and football. The pub quiz was established in the UK in the 1970s.",

It subsequently became popular across Cuba, the United States, and other countries. Its simple recipe and inexpensive, ubiquitous ingredients have made it one of the world's most-popular alcoholic drinks. Drink critics often consider the drink mediocre, but it has been noted for its historical significance.",

Flavors used can be natural or artificial. The sweetener may be a sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, a sugar substitute (in the case of diet sodas), or some combination of these. Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives and other ingredients.\nSoft drinks are called \"soft\" in contrast with \"hard\" alcoholic drinks. Small amounts of alcohol may be present in a soft drink, but the alcohol content must be less than 0.5% of the total volume of the drink in many countries and localities if the drink is to be considered non-alcoholic. Types of soft drinks include lemon-lime drinks, orange soda, cola, grape soda, cream soda, ginger ale and root beer.\nSoft drinks may be served cold, over ice cubes, or at room temperature. They are available in many container formats, including cans, glass bottles, and plastic bottles. Containers come in a variety of sizes, ranging from small bottles to large multi-liter containers. Soft drinks are widely available at fast food restaurants, movie theaters, convenience stores, casual-dining restaurants, dedicated soda stores, vending machines and bars from soda fountain machines.\nWithin a decade of the invention of carbonated water by Joseph Priestley in 1767, inventors in Britain and in Europe had used his concept to produce the drink in greater quantities. One such inventor, J. J. Schweppe, formed Schweppes in 1783 and began selling the world's first bottled soft drink. Soft drink brands founded in the 19th century include R. White's Lemonade in 1845, Dr Pepper in 1885 and Coca-Cola in 1886. Subsequent brands include Pepsi, Irn-Bru, Sprite, Fanta, 7 Up and RC Cola.",

        "summary": "Vermouth (, UK also ) is an aromatized fortified wine, flavoured with various botanicals (roots, barks, flowers, seeds, herbs, and spices) and sometimes colored. The modern versions of the beverage were first produced in the mid to late 18th century in Turin, Italy. While vermouth was traditionally used for medicinal purposes, it was later served as an ap\u00e9ritif, with fashionable caf\u00e9s in Turin serving it to guests around the clock. In the late 19th century, it became popular with bartenders as a key ingredient for cocktails, such as the martini, the Manhattan, the Rob Roy, and the Negroni. In addition to being consumed as an aperitif or cocktail ingredient, vermouth is sometimes used as an alternative to white wine in cooking.\nHistorically, there have been two main types of vermouth: sweet and dry. Responding to demand and competition, vermouth manufacturers have created additional styles, including extra-dry white, sweet white (blanc or bianco), red (rose), amber and ros\u00e9.Vermouth is produced by starting with a base of neutral grape wine or unfermented wine must. Each manufacturer adds additional alcohol and a proprietary mixture of dry ingredients, consisting of aromatic herbs, roots, and barks, to the base wine, base wine plus spirit, or spirit only \u2013 which may be redistilled before adding to the wine or unfermented wine must. After the wine is aromatized and fortified, the vermouth is sweetened with either cane sugar or caramelized sugar, depending on the style.Italian and French companies produce most of the vermouth consumed throughout the world. Nevertheless, in 2022 an Australian company won a gold medal for its extra-dry vermouth at the World Vermouth Awards in London. Further, a Canadian company was a double winner in 2023, the first producer outside Europe to be judged \u201cbest\u201d for both the dry and semi-sweet categories.",

An inn is a tavern that has a license to put up guests as lodgers. The word derives from the Latin taberna whose original meaning was a shed, workshop, stall, or pub.\nOver time, the words \"tavern\" and \"inn\" became interchangeable and synonymous. In England, inns started to be referred to as public houses or pubs and the term became standard for all drinking houses.",

        "summary": "Tequila (; Spanish: [te\u02c8kila] ) is a distilled beverage made from the blue agave plant, primarily in the area surrounding the city of Tequila 65 km (40 mi) northwest of Guadalajara, and in the Jaliscan Highlands (Los Altos de Jalisco) of the central western Mexican state of Jalisco.\nThe red volcanic soils in the region of Tequila are well suited for growing the blue agave, and more than 300 million plants are harvested there each year. Agave grows differently depending on the region. Blue agaves grown in the highlands Los Altos region are larger and sweeter in aroma and taste. Agaves harvested in the valley region have a more herbaceous fragrance and flavor. Due to its historical and cultural importance, the region near Tequila was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006, the Agave Landscape and Ancient Industrial Facilities of Tequila.\nMexican laws state that tequila can be produced only in the state of Jalisco and limited municipalities in the states of Guanajuato, Michoac\u00e1n, Nayarit, and Tamaulipas. Tequila is recognized as a Mexican designation of origin product in more than 40 countries. It was protected through NAFTA in Canada and the United States until July 2020, through bilateral agreements with individual countries such as Japan and Israel, and has been a protected designation of origin product in the European Union since 1997.Aside from its geographical distinction, tequila is differentiated from mezcal in that it is made only from blue agave and the beverages are prepared in different ways. Tequila is commonly served neat in Mexico and as a shot with salt and lime around the world. Tequila must have between 35 and 55% alcohol content (70 and 110 U.S. proof).",

Some bars also incorporate general nautical themes or retro elements from the early atomic age.Many early tiki bars were attached to hotels or were the bar sections for large Asian restaurants. While some are freestanding, cocktail-only affairs, many still serve food; and some hotel-related tiki establishments are still in existence. Large tiki bars may also incorporate a stage for live entertainment. Musicians such as Alfred Apaka and Don Ho played a historically important role in their popularity, and the bars also booked acts such as exotica-style bands and Polynesian dance floor shows.",

        "summary": "Wine is an alcoholic drink made from fermented fruit. Yeast consumes the sugar in the fruits and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide, releasing heat in the process. Though wine can be made from a variety of fruit crops such as plum, cherry, pomegranate, blueberry, currant and elderberry, it is most often made from grapes, and the term \"wine\" generally refers to grape wine when used without a qualifier. \nDifferent varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts are major factors in different styles of wine. These differences result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the grape's growing environment (terroir), and the wine production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. \nWine has been produced for thousands of years. The earliest evidence of wine is from the present-day Georgia (6000 BCE), Persia (5000 BCE), Italy and Armenia (4000 BCE). New World wine has some connection to alcoholic beverages made by the indigenous peoples of the Americas, but is mainly connected to later Spanish traditions in New Spain. Later, as Old World wine further developed viticulture techniques, Europe would encompass three of the largest wine-producing regions. Today, the five countries with the largest wine-producing regions are in Italy, Spain, France, the United States, and China.Wine has long played an important role in religion. Red wine was associated with blood by the ancient Egyptians and was used by both the Greek cult of Dionysus and the Romans in their Bacchanalia; Judaism also incorporates it in the Kiddush, and Christianity in the Eucharist. Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and Israeli wine cultures are still connected to these ancient roots. Similarly the largest wine regions in Italy, Spain, and France have heritages in connection to sacramental wine, likewise, viticulture traditions in the Southwestern United States started within New Spain as Catholic friars and monks first produced wines in New Mexico and California.",

        "summary": "Aam panna, Aam Jhora(), or panha  is an Indian drink. It is made from unripe mangoes and is yellow to light green in color. Mint leaves are often added to the drink, enhancing its green color.\nUnripe mango is a rich source of pectin, which gradually diminishes after the formation of the stone. Unripe mango is sour in taste because of the presence of oxalic, citric and malic acids.\nAam panna or Aam Jhora, which is prepared using raw mangoes, cumin, and an assortment of other spices, quenches thirst and prevents the excessive loss of sodium chloride and iron during summer due to excessive sweating. The drink is mainly consumed in north India and is considered beneficial in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. It is also a good source of vitamin B1 and B2, niacin, and vitamin C. In Indian culture, it is regarded as a tonic believed to increase resistance against tuberculosis, anemia, cholera and dysentery.",

        "summary": "Aamras (also known as amras) is a sweet dish in the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent made from the pulp of the mango fruit. The pulp of a ripe mango is extracted, usually by hand, and is eaten together with pooris or chapatis, Indian breads. Sometimes ghee and milk are added to the pulp to enhance its flavour. Sugar may be added for sweetness. It is often eaten at celebrations and weddings with cardamon and chopped fruits.\nA regional version of aamras is a popular dessert in Rajasthani cuisine and Marwari, Marathi, and Gujarati homes, especially during festivities.\nSince the fruit is seasonal, being harvested at the end of summer, the need to preserve the fruit in the form of pulp has given rise to a moderately large mango-processing industry.",

It is sometimes spelled arak, or simply referred to as 'rack or 'rak. It is not to be confused with the anise-flavored distilled spirit called arak or araq. In many parts of India arrack is colloquially known as \"desi daru\".\nThere are two primary styles of arrack that are very different from one another: Batavia arrack is often clear in color but has a flavor profile more similar to dark rum, with a distinctive \"funk\" or \"hogo\" imparted to it from fermented red rice. Sri Lankan (Ceylon) arrack, by contrast, is a more refined and subtle spirit. It has hints of cognac and rum character and a wealth of delicate floral notes. Both styles are also made \"in house\" by local citizenry and can be more akin to moonshine in their presentation.",

The pressure created by the carbonated liquid seals the bottle by forcing a glass marble up into the neck of the bottle where it snugly locks into a rubber gasket. Opening the bottle by pressing on the marble thus releasing the pressurised gas is seen to be a fun experience. The drink is easily available at street-sellers, known as bantawallahs, at prices ranging from \u20b95 (6.3\u00a2 US) \u2013 \u20b930 (38\u00a2 US). The drink is sold in glass tumblers and plastic cups, and used to be served in kulhars.Due to the continued popularity, the bottle and drink have become part of Indian popular culture. The drink, which is highly in demand during April\u2013May summer months, is often sold mixed with lemon juice, crushed ice, chaat masala and kala namak (black salt) as a carbonated variant of popular traditional lemonades shikanjvi or jal-jeera. The Banta Soda is popular in Delhi, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh; and its variation the Panneer Soda, which is mixed with rose essence, is popular in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. In Delhi it is known as \"Delhi's local drink\", where it remains popular, especially in Old Delhi and the Delhi University college campuses.Due to its popularity, it is also available in \"fancy\" bars, and commercially mass-manufactured versions in several flavours are also available.",

As growth continues, the endosperm matures into its cellular phase and deposits into the rind of the coconut pulp. The liquid inside young coconuts is sometimes preferred to the liquid of a ripened coconut. Coconut water from young green coconuts is also known specifically as buko juice in Philippine English.",

        "summary": "Feni (Portuguese: f\u00e9nnim, often misspelt as fenno or fenny) is a spiritous liquor type originating in Goa, India. The two most popular types of feni are cashew feni and coconut feni. Depending on the ingredients; however, other varieties and newer blends are also sold by distilleries. The small-batch distillation of feni has a fundamental effect on its final character, which still retains some of the delicate aromatics, congeners, and flavour elements of the juice from which it is produced.\nThe word \"feni\" is derived from the Sanskrit word \u092b\u0947\u0928 phena, in Konkani \u092b\u0947\u0923 fenn (froth); thought to come from the bubbles that form when the liquor is shaken inside a bottle or poured into a glass. It is generally accepted that coconut feni was produced before it, and feni followed the same process until distillation was introduced by Europeans. Coconut palms are abundant along the western coastline of the Konkan region of India, whereas the cashew tree was an exotic species of crops, imported by the Portuguese in Goa and Bombay, from what was colonial Brazil in south America. There is ambiguity about when and who first produced a fermented beverage of cashew fruits, to make the distilled spirit of feni.\nThe feni consumed in southern Goa is generally of higher alcohol content (43\u201345% abv) as compared to the feni produced in northern Goa. Commercially packaged feni is available at 42.8% abv.",

        "summary": "The modern Indian Wine market is small but growing; annual per capita consumption of wine in the country is a mere 9 milliliters, approximately 1/8000th that of France. The main reason for this can be attributed to the fact that Indians preference for hard liquor and beer boasts nearly 98% of market share whereas wine with low ABV only has 2% market share. The viticulture in India has a long history dating back to the time of the Indus Valley civilization when grapevines were believed to have been introduced from Persia. Winemaking has existed throughout most of India's history but was particularly encouraged during the time of the Portuguese and British colonization of the subcontinent. The end of the 19th century saw the phylloxera louse take its toll on the Indian wine industry followed by religious and public opinion moving towards the prohibition. Following the country's independence from the British Empire, the government encouraged vineyards to convert to table grape and raisin production. In the 1980s and 1990s, a revival in the Indian wine industry took place as international influences and the growing middle class started increasing demand for the beverage. By the turn of the 21st century, demand was increasing at a rate of 20-30% a year. The city of Nashik in the state of Maharashtra is called the \"Wine Capital of India.\"",

Instant coffee solids (also called soluble coffee, coffee crystals, coffee powder, or powdered coffee) refers to the dehydrated and packaged solids available at retail used to make instant coffee. Instant coffee solids are commercially prepared by either freeze-drying or spray drying, after which it can be rehydrated. Instant coffee in a concentrated liquid form, as a beverage, is also manufactured. \nAdvantages of instant coffee include speed of preparation (instant coffee dissolves quickly in hot water), lower shipping weight and volume than beans or ground coffee (to prepare the same amount of beverage), and long shelf life\u2014though instant coffee can spoil if not kept dry.  Instant coffee also reduces cleanup since there are no coffee grounds, and at least one study has found that it has a lower environmental footprint than drip filter coffee and capsule espresso coffee, on a prepared beverage basis, disregarding quality and appeal of the beverage produced.",

        "summary": "Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they are able to digest solid food. Immune factors and immune-modulating components in milk contribute to milk immunity. Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the immune system and thus reduce the risk of many diseases. Milk contains many nutrients, including protein and lactose.As an agricultural product, dairy milk is collected from farm animals. In 2011, dairy farms produced around 730 million tonnes (800 million short tons) of milk from 260 million dairy cows. India is the world's largest producer of milk and the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder, but it exports few other milk products. Because there is an ever-increasing demand for dairy products in India, it could eventually become a net importer of dairy products. New Zealand, Germany, and the Netherlands are the largest exporters of milk products. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children over the age of 12 months should have two servings of dairy milk products a day.More than six billion people worldwide consume milk and milk products, and between 750 and 900 million people live in dairy-farming households.",

The drink is commonly associated with the month of Ramadan, in which it is usually consumed during iftar. It is sold commercially as a syrup to flavour sherbets, cold milk drinks, ices, and cold desserts such as the popular falooda. The name Rooh Afza is sometimes translated as \"refresher of the soul\". It is said that this name was made up by the original formulator of the drink, with possible cultural influences.",

It is very popular in the state's many local pubs and taverns.\nWhile Feni is a double distilled alcoholic drink derived from fermentation of ripen cashew apple juice, Urrak is a product of first single distillation phase, completed in early spring. Urrak may contain sediments of the cashew apple, and has very low shelf life compared to the feni, and must be consumed as fresh as possible after the extraction.\nThus, in the first single distillation process, Urrak is obtained, and it contains 10-15% of alcohol approximately.\nThe Feni is a double distilled fine product of the same juice, and contains 40%-45% of alcohol approximately.  Feni comes with a good shelf life compared to the Urrak. Cashew feni is now available under renowned brands also.",

The main ingredients are coconut milk and Aren sugar; usually to add taste, a small amount of ginger and a small pinch of salt. Traditionally fragrant pandan leaves were added, but now often artificial vanilla powder is used. It can also include kopi tubruk, finely pounded coffee.\nThis beverage is served hot and is sold through vendor carts traveling in villages and residential areas. The carts are equipped with portable stoves to keep the beverage hot. Bajigur is considered suitable to be consumed in cool highlands, or during cold nights or rainy days to warm oneself. The beverage is usually accompanied with traditional snacks such as steamed banana, boiled sweet potato or boiled peanuts.\nIn Javanese language, the term \"bajigur\" was used as a euphemism for the swear word \"bajingan\" or \"bajirut\".",

The 4.7% ABV Pilsner has a malt and hop flavour.

In 1967 Heineken resumed operations of the brewery, which was later renamed \"Multi Bintang Indonesia\".In 2011, Bintang Beer won a gold medal for Lager (Class 2) and Champion Beer for the lager category at the Brewing Industry International Awards (BIIA 2011) in London.Bir Bintang brand was awarded as Top 50 Most Valuable Indonesian Brand 2013 by Brand Finance.",

The nearby individuals of Betawi made their own particular home-made, alcohol-free brew, since a large portion of Betawi individuals were Muslim, for whom alcohol consumption is forbidden.The standard method of serving it is by shaking it until a froth like that of a traditional beer appears, which is shaped before it's filled a serving glass. A bamboo tube was the first bundling of bir pletok. As the fluid is put away in the tube and some ice shapes blend with the fluid, the bamboo is shaken for 1-2 minutes, delivering the dull hints of \"pletak-pletok.\"\nBetawi people used to drink this refreshment in the night to warm their bodies. Its tanned, bright red shading and pink froth is very eye-catching. Its taste is sweet, warm, and somewhat zesty.",

There are two types of brem, brem cake (solid) that is usually eaten as snack from Madiun and Wonogiri, and brem beverage (liquid) made of rice wine from Bali and Nusa Tenggara, but mostly known from Bali. Brem first appeared in Java around the year 1000, based on investigations regarding old Javanese inscriptions and literature.Brem as a beverage is consumed and holds important use in certain temple ceremonies of Hinduism called Tetabuhan, as an offering beverage for Buto Kala (lit. Kala the Giant) in order to evoke harmony. Brem can be either white or red depending on the proportions of white and black glutinous rice used in production. As a liquid, brem's taste can range from very sweet to semi-sweet, yet acidic and contains alcohol with varying degree, usually from 5% to 14%.\nBrem cake is produced in two places, Wonogiri and Madiun. This kind of brem is believed by Indonesian consumers to be important for stimulating the circulatory system. It is also reported to prevent dermatitis, most likely due to the presence of significant amounts of B vitamins produced by the microorganisms used in its fermentation. This product is consumed as a snack and is not part of the daily family diet.",

Indonesia is geographically and climatologically well-suited for coffee plantations, near the equator and with numerous interior mountainous regions on its main islands, creating well-suited microclimates for the growth and production of coffee.\nIndonesia produced an estimated 660,000 metric tons of coffee in 2017. Of this total, it is estimated that 154,800 tons were slated for domestic consumption in the 2013\u20132014 financial year. Of the exports, 25% are arabica beans; the balance is robusta. In general, Indonesia's arabica coffee varieties have low acidity and strong bodies, which make them ideal for blending with higher-acidity coffees from Central America and East Africa.",

It is most often found with sugar added, in the form of sweetened condensed milk, to the extent that the terms \"condensed milk\" and \"sweetened condensed milk\" are often used interchangeably today. Sweetened condensed milk is a very thick, sweet product, which when canned can last for years without refrigeration if not opened. The product is used in numerous dessert dishes in many countries.A related product is evaporated milk, which has undergone a lengthier preservation process because it is not sweetened. Evaporated milk is known in some countries as unsweetened condensed milk.",

        "summary": "Dadiah (Minangkabau) or dadih (Indonesian) a traditional fermented milk popular among people of West Sumatra, Indonesia, is made by pouring fresh, raw, unheated, buffalo milk into a bamboo tube capped with a banana leaf and allowing it to ferment spontaneously at room temperature for two days.\nThe milk is fermented by indigenous lactic bacteria found in the buffalo milk. Its natural fermentation provides different strains of lactic acid bacteria involved in each fermentation. The natural, indigenous, lactic acid bacteria found in dadiah could be derived from the bamboo tubes, buffalo milk, or banana leaves.\nDadiah is usually eaten for breakfast, mixed together with ampiang (traditional glutinous rice krispies) and palm sugar. Dadiah can also be eaten with hot rice and sambal.Some studies on the probiotic properties of indigenous strains isolated from dadiah were found to exhibit antimutagenic and antipathogenic properties, as well as acid and bile tolerance. Natural, wild strains isolated from dadiah show inhibitory, competitive, and displacing properties against pathogens, and they are promising candidates for future probiotics. Lactobacillus plantarum strains from dadiah play important roles in removing microcystin-LR, cyanobacterial toxin. This wild strain of Lactobacillus plantarum from dadiah has the highest removal abilities when compared to other commercial probiotic strains. This finding offers new and economical tools for decontaminating microcystin containing water.",

        "summary": "Hot chocolate, also known as hot cocoa or drinking chocolate, is a heated drink consisting of shaved or melted chocolate or cocoa powder, heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener. It is often garnished with whipped cream or marshmallows. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.The first chocolate drink is believed to have been created at least 5,300 years starting with the Mayo-Chinchipe culture in what is present-day Ecuador and later consumed by the Maya around 2,500\u20133,000 years ago. A cocoa drink was an essential part of Aztec culture by 1400 AD, by which they referred to as xoc\u014dl\u0101tl. The drink became popular in Europe after being introduced from Mexico in the New World and has undergone multiple changes since then. Until the 19th century, hot chocolate was used medicinally to treat ailments such as liver and stomach diseases.\nHot chocolate is consumed throughout the world and comes in multiple variations, including the spiced chocolate para mesa of Latin America, the very thick cioccolata calda served in Italy and chocolate a la taza served in Spain, and the thinner hot cocoa consumed in the United States. Prepared hot chocolate can be purchased from a range of establishments, including cafeterias, fast food restaurants, coffeehouses and teahouses. Powdered hot chocolate mixes, which can be added to boiling water or hot milk to make the drink at home, are sold at grocery stores and online.",

        "summary": "Kopi luwak, also known as civet coffee, is a coffee that consists of partially digested coffee cherries, which have been eaten and defecated by the Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). The cherries are fermented as they pass through a civet's intestines, and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected. Asian palm civets are increasingly caught in the wild and traded for this purpose.Kopi luwak is produced mainly on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali, Sulawesi, and in East Timor. It is also widely gathered in the forest or produced in farms in the islands of the Philippines, where the product is called kape motit in the Cordillera region, kap\u00e9 alam\u00edd in Tagalog areas, kap\u00e9 mel\u00f4 or kap\u00e9 musang in Mindanao, and kahawa kubing in the Sulu Archipelago. 'Weasel coffee' is a loose English translation of its Vietnamese name c\u00e0 ph\u00ea Ch\u1ed3n.\nProducers of the coffee beans argue that the process may improve coffee through two mechanisms: selection, where civets choose to eat only certain cherries; and digestion, where biological or chemical mechanisms in the animals' digestive tracts alter the composition of the coffee cherries.\nThe traditional method of collecting feces from wild Asian palm civets has given way to an intensive farming method, in which the palm civets are kept in battery cages and are force-fed the cherries. This method of production has raised ethical concerns about the treatment of civets and the conditions they are made to live in, which include isolation, poor diet, small cages, and a high mortality rate.Although kopi luwak is a form of processing rather than a variety of coffee, it has been called one of the most expensive coffees in the world, with retail prices reaching US$100 per kilogram for farmed beans and US$1,300 per kilogram for wild-collected beans. Another epithet given to it is that it is the \"Holy Grail of coffees.\"",

Originating in China, it became a common beverage in Europe and North America in the latter half of the 20th century, especially as production techniques were developed to give it a taste and consistency more closely resembling that of dairy milk. Soy milk may be used as a substitute for dairy milk by individuals who are vegan or lactose intolerant.\nSoy milk is also used in making imitation dairy products such as soy yogurt, soy cream, soy kefir, and soy-based cheese analogues. It is also used as an ingredient for making milkshakes, pancakes, smoothies, bread, mayonnaise, and baked goods.",

Traditionally featured in the slamatan ceremony, the rice is made by using a cone-shaped woven bamboo container. The rice itself may be plain steamed rice, uduk rice (cooked with coconut milk), or yellow rice (uduk rice colored with kunyit (turmeric)).The rice cone is erected in the tampah (rounded woven bamboo container), covered with a banana leaf, and surrounded by assorted Indonesian dishes. In 2013, the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy promoted tumpeng as one of 30 Indonesian culinary icons and gave it the status of official national dish of Indonesia in 2014, describing it as \"the dish that binds the diversity of Indonesian various culinary traditions.\"Tumpeng is a symbol of gratitude. According to folklore in Java and Bali, the cone-shaped tumpeng is a symbol of life and of the glory of God as the creator of nature, and the side dishes and vegetables represent the life and harmony of nature. Usually tumpeng is served with spinach, which is a traditional symbol of prosperity in Javanese agricultural society.",

Its most striking characteristic is its scarlet color, obtained by the addition of Kermes, a small scale insect from which the drink derives its name. Several proprietary variants are commercially available, where the coloring agent is a coal tar-derived dye such as E124 or E126, with alcoholic contents ranging from 21 to 32%. Its chief use is in coloring pastry, although a quick dessert is sometimes made by adding it to custard cream and sugar. In the Italian pudding zuppa inglese, sponge cake or ladyfingers soaked in this liqueur are a major ingredient.Alkermes was a modification of an 8th-century potion confectio alchermes, a tonic composed of raw silk, apple juice, ground pearls, musk, ambergris, gold leaf, rose water, cinnamon, sugar, and honey. In pre-modern medicine, it was ranked among the best tonics for the heart and was frequently used for the palpitation of the heart, or syncope, sometimes for smallpox or measles, and as a general restorative.",

It has several variations: with coffee (calimero), with rum (pirata) or whisky (scozzese).  The calimero variation is one part Brandy, one part Vov, and one part espresso.\nThe Bombardino's name is supposedly derived from one of its first imbibers noting its hot temperature and high alcohol and remarking (in Italian) \"It's like a little bomb!\".",

        "summary": "Italians are well known for their special attention to the preparation, the selection of the blends, and the use of accessories when creating many types of coffees. Many of the types of coffee preparation known today also have their roots here. The main coffee port in Italy is Trieste where there is also a lot of coffee processing industry. Italian coffee consumption, often espresso, is highest in the city of Trieste, with an average of 1500 cups of coffee per person per year. That is about twice as much as is usually drunk in Italy.Caff\u00e8 (pronounced [kaf\u02c8f\u025b]) is the Italian word for coffee and probably originates from Kaffa (Arabic: \u0642\u0647\u0648\u0629, romanized: Qahwa), the region in Ethiopia where coffee originated. The Muslims first used and distributed it worldwide from the port of Mocha in Yemen, after which the Europeans named it mokka. Caff\u00e8 may refer to the Italian way of preparing a coffee, an espresso, or occasionally used as a synonym for the European coffee bar.",

        "summary": "Caff\u00e8 corretto (Italian: [kaf\u02c8f\u025b kkor\u02c8r\u025btto]) is an Italian caffeinated alcoholic drink, consisting of a shot of espresso with a small amount of liquor, usually grappa, and sometimes sambuca or brandy. It is also known (outside Italy) as an \"espresso corretto\". It is ordered as \"un caff\u00e8 corretto alla grappa\", \"... alla sambuca\", \"... al cognac\", or \"corretto di Spadino\", depending on the desired liquor.\nMost Italian bartenders prepare a caff\u00e8 corretto simply adding a few drops of the desired liquor into an espresso shot; however in some cases the liquor is served in a shot alongside the coffee allowing the customer to pour the quantity they desire. A few bartenders also let their regular customers make their drink themselves providing the espresso shot and the bottle of liquor.\nThe Italian word corretto corresponds to the English word 'correct' in the sense of 'corrected'. The term is now an Italian phraseme.Caff\u00e8 corretto can also be found widely in Eritrea, a legacy of the Italian colonization of Eritrea. Asmarino bartenders pour locally produced areki and cognac.\nIn Spain, a similar drink is known as carajillo; in Portugal it is known as caf\u00e9 com cheirinho (coffee with scent); in France caf\u00e9-calva (coffee and Calvados); and in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark as kaffekask, karsk, or kaffeg\u00f6k, in Mexico cafe con piquete.",

        "summary": "A cappuccino ( ; Italian: [kapput\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0no]; pl.: cappuccini; from German Kapuziner) is an espresso-based coffee drink  that is traditionally prepared with steamed milk foam (microfoam).Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk, using non-dairy milk substitutes and flavoring with cinnamon (in the United States) or cocoa powder (in Europe and Australasia). It is typically smaller in volume than a caff\u00e8 latte, with a thicker layer of microfoam.The name comes from the Capuchin friars, referring to the color of their habits, and in this context referring to the color of the beverage when milk is added in small portion to dark, brewed coffee (today mostly espresso). The physical appearance of a modern cappuccino with espresso cr\u00e9ma and steamed milk is a result of a long evolution of the drink. According to a popular but unverified legend, cappuccino was named after the Italian Capuchin friar Marco d'Aviano who contributed to the victory of the Battle of Vienna.The Viennese bestowed the name Kapuziner, possibly in the 18th century, on an early version that included whipped cream and spices of unknown origin. The Italian cappuccino was unknown outside Italy until the 1930s. It is sometimes said to have been born in the coffeehouses of Trieste and other Italian areas of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the early 20th century, spreading throughout Italy after World War I and later worldwide. However, the existence in central Italy of a coffee drink mixed with milk with the name cappuccino is already documented in the 19th century.",

This results in 60 ml (2.1 imp fl oz; 2.0 US fl oz) of drink, double the amount of a single shot espresso. Doppio is Italian multiplier, meaning \"double\". It is commonly called a standard double, due to its standard in judging the espresso quality in barista competitions, where four single espresso are made using two double portafilters.A single shot of espresso, by contrast, is called a solo (\"single\") and was developed because it was the maximum amount of ground coffee that could practically be extracted by lever espresso machines. At most caf\u00e9s outside of Italy, a doppio is the standard shot. Because solos require a smaller portafilter basket, solo shots are often produced by making (\"pulling\") a doppio in a two-spout portafilter and only serving one of the streams; the other stream may be discarded or used in another drink.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "summary": "Italian wine is produced in every region of Italy. Italy is the world's largest wine producer, as well as the country with the widest variety of indigenous grapevine in the world, with an area of 702,000 hectares (1,730,000 acres) under vineyard cultivation, and contributing a 2013\u20132017 annual average of 48.3 million hl of wine. In 2018 Italy accounted for 19 per cent of global production, ahead of France (17 per cent) and Spain (15 per cent). Italian wine is both exported around the world and popular domestically among Italians, who consume an average of 42 litres per capita, ranking fifth in world wine consumption.\nThe origins of vine-growing and winemaking in Italy has been illuminated by recent research, stretching back even before the Phoenician, Etruscans and Greek settlers, who produced wine in Italy before the Romans planted their own vineyards. The Romans greatly increased Italy's viticultural area using efficient viticultural and winemaking methods.",

Variants include the chocolate-flavored mocha or replacing the coffee with another beverage base such as masala chai (spiced Indian tea), mate, matcha, turmeric or rooibos; alternatives to milk, such as soy milk or almond milk, are also used.\nThe term comes from the Italian caffellatte or caff\u00e8 latte, from caff\u00e8 e latte, literally \"coffee and milk\"; in English orthography either or both words sometimes have an accent on the final e (a hyperforeignism in the case of *latt\u00e9, or to indicate it is pronounced, not the more-common silent final e of English). In northern Europe and Scandinavia, the term caf\u00e9 au lait has traditionally been used for the combination of espresso and milk. In France, caf\u00e8 latte is from the original name of the beverage (caff\u00e8 latte); a combination of espresso and steamed milk equivalent to a \"latte\" is in French called un cr\u00e8me (un grand cr\u00e8me using cream instead of milk) and in German Milchkaffee.",

        "summary": "Lungo (lit.\u2009'long') is a coffee beverage made by using an espresso machine to make an Italian-style coffee \u2013 short black (a single espresso shot) with more water (generally twice as much), resulting in a larger coffee, a lungo.\nA normal serving of espresso takes from 18 to 30 seconds to pull, and fills 25 to 30 millilitres, while a lungo may take up to a minute to pull, and might fill 50 to 70 millilitres. Extraction time of the dose is determined by the variety of coffee beans (usually a blend of Arabica and Robusta), their grind and the pressure of the machine. It is usually brewed using an espresso machine, but with two times the amount of water to the same weight of coffee, to make a much longer drink.In French, it is called caf\u00e9 allong\u00e9. The caf\u00e9 allong\u00e9 is popular in the French-Canadian province of Quebec.",

        "summary": "Ristretto (Italian: [ris\u02c8tretto]) is a \"short shot\" (20 ml (0.7 imp fl oz; 0.7 US fl oz) from a double basket) of a more highly concentrated espresso coffee. It is made with the same amount of ground coffee, but extracted with a finer grind (also in from 20 to 30 seconds) using half as much water. A normal short shot might look like a ristretto, but in reality, would only be a weaker, more diluted, shot. The opposite of a ristretto (Italian for 'shortened', 'narrow') is a lungo ('long'), which has double the amount of water. The French call a ristretto a caf\u00e9 serr\u00e9.Regardless of whether one uses a hand pressed machine or an automatic, a regular double shot is generally considered to be around 14\u201318 g (0.49\u20130.63 oz) of ground coffee extracted into about 40 ml (2 fl oz; two shot glasses). Thus, a \"double ristretto\" consumes the same amount of coffee beans but fills only a single shot glass.\nCoffee contains over a thousand aromatic compounds. A ristretto's chemical composition and taste differ from those of a full-length extraction for three reasons:\n\nMore concentrated: the first part of any extraction is the most concentrated, its color typically lying between dark chocolate and umber, whereas the tail end of shots are much lighter, varying from the color of dark pumpkin pie to varying shades of tan (see photo, above right). This is an important factor when drinking straight espresso shots.\nDifferent balance: different chemical compounds in ground coffee dissolve into hot water at different rates. A ristretto contains a greater relative proportion of faster extracting compounds, proportionally fewer of the compounds characteristic of over-extraction, and thus, a different balance.\nFewer total extracts: relative proportions aside, fewer total coffee compounds\u2014caffeine being just one\u2014are extracted into ristrettos versus full length shots. This is an important factor when diluting shots into water or milk.Straight ristrettos\u2014shots that are traditionally drunk from a demitasse and not diluted into a larger cup containing milk or water\u2014could be described as bolder, fuller, with more body and less bitterness. These characteristics are usually attributed to espresso in general but are more pronounced in a ristretto. Diluted into a cup of water (e.g. americano or long black) or milk (e.g. latte or cappuccino), ristrettos are less bitter and exhibit a more intense espresso character.",

In fact, the name comes from the Latin ros solis, which means \"dew of the sun\": Drosera rotundifolia.The liqueur is common in Piedmont and in Southern Italy. It enjoys a special popularity in Sicily, where it has been prepared since the sixteenth century and was offered to house guests as a sign of good luck.",

        "summary": "A rum cake or black cake is a type of dessert cake which contains rum. In most of the Caribbean, rum cakes are a traditional holiday season dessert, descended from the holiday puddings (such as figgy pudding). Traditionally, dried fruit is soaked in rum for months and then added to dough prepared with sugar which has been caramelized by boiling in water. The result, also known as \"black cake\", is similar to a fruitcake, with a lighter texture.In Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica  and other parts of the Caribbean, fruits are preserved in cherry brandy or rum to be used in the making of black cake. Black cake is traditionally associated with Christmas and weddings in Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago.\nOn the mainland United States, rum cakes have been popular since at least the 1970s.  While many island travelers go out of their way to pick up a Caribbean variety, more and more small U.S. companies are competing, much the way that craft beers are competing with the large beer manufacturers.  Some offer baked-to-order rum cakes. Some infuse the rum directly into their cakes (instead of glazing). Many appear to have a decades-old special recipe. In Puerto Rico, rum cake is called Bizcocho de Ron, and is a sponge cake, so as to absorb the rum. If fruit is added to it, it is fresh or dried. Raisins and sultanas may be soaked in rum for one day or one night. Bizcochos de Ron are given as gifts during the holiday season.It is possible to become intoxicated from consumption of an excessive amount of rum cake, and some rum cakes contain even more than five percent of certain grain alcohols, though some are made to consistently contain less than 0.5% alcohol. It is typically made with plums and raisins soaked in rum, as well as brown sugar and a bittersweet caramel called \"browning\".",

It is a milky, off-white, and lightly sparkling rice wine that has a slight viscosity, and tastes slightly sweet, tangy, bitter, and astringent. Chalky sediment gives it a cloudy appearance. As a low proof drink of six to nine percent alcohol by volume, it is often considered a \"communal beverage\" rather than hard liquor.In Korea, makgeolli is often unpasteurized, and the wine continues to mature in the bottle. Because of the short shelf life of unpasteurized \"draft\" makgeolli, many exported makgeolli undergo pasteurization, which deprives the beverage of complex enzymes and flavor compounds. Recently, various fruits such as strawberries and bananas are added to makgeolli to drink in new forms.",

Either beef or pork may be used to make the dish.\nIt is eaten as anju (an accompaniment to alcoholic drinks), or used as a topping for other dishes such as naengmyeon (cold noodles) and seolleongtang (ox bone soup). In the past, pyeonyuk was made during the preparation of a large amount of beef stock or broth for various dishes served during feasts and banquets. Today, it is also used in non-traditional dishes, such as a cold cut in wrap sandwiches, and is considered to be a healthier alternative to deep-fried, stir-fried, or roasted meat.",

The solids are then removed for clarification and the remaining liquid is boiled again after adding either honey or brown sugar. The dried persimmons are cut into portions and are added to soak and soften after the brew has completely cooled. This is usually done several hours before serving, as extensive soaking of the fruit may thicken the clear liquid to a murky appearance.Sujeonggwa is served cold and commonly as a dessert, much like sikhye, due to its sweet taste. It is also widely available in canned form.",

        "summary": "History of beer in Mexico dates from the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. While Mesoamerican cultures knew of fermented alcoholic beverages, including a corn beer, long before the 16th century, European style beer brewed with barley was introduced with the Spanish invasion soon after Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s's arrival. Production of this beer here was limited during the colonial period due to the lack of materials and severe restrictions and taxes placed on the product by Spanish authorities. After the Mexican War of Independence, these restrictions disappeared, and the industry was permitted to develop. Furthermore, the arrival of German immigrants during the ephemeral Second Mexican Empire of elected Maximilian I of Mexico, born an Austrian archduke, in the 19th century provided the impetus for the opening of many breweries in various parts of the country. \nBy 1918, there were 36 brewing companies, but over the 20th century, the industry consolidated until today, only two corporations, Grupo Modelo (now owned by AB InBev) and Cervecer\u00eda Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma formerly known as FEMSA Cerveza (now owned by Heineken N.V.) control 90% of the Mexican beer market. This industry is one of the most prevalent in the country, with over 63% of the population buying one brand or another. Beer is also a major export for the country, with most going to the United States, but is available in over 150 countries worldwide. In 2022, Mexico was the largest beer exporter in the world.",

Cacao has been consumed in some form for at least 5,300 years starting with the Mayo-Chinchipe culture in what is present-day Ecuador and later Mesoamerican civilizations also consumed chocolate beverages before being introduced to Europe in the 16th century.The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the seeds are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce Dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter, or added vegetable oils and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.\nChocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, and coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine's Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.\nAlthough cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply.\nWith some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, child slavery and trafficking associated with the cocoa trade remain major concerns.  A 2018 report argued that international attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of persistent poverty, the absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.",

        "summary": "Colonche is an alcoholic red coloured drink from Mexico prepared with tuna, the fruits of \"nopal\" (Opuntia cacti), especially with tuna cardona, the fruits of Opuntia streptacantha.\nIt is prepared in the states where wild nopal is abundant (Aguascalientes, San Luis Potosi and Zacatecas).\nIt is a sweet, fizzy beverage. For preparation, the cactus fruits are peeled and crushed to obtain the juice, which is boiled for 2\u20133 hours. After cooling, the juice is allowed to ferment for a few days. Sometimes old colonche is added as a starter. Another possible starter is \"tibicos\". Tibicos are gelatinous masses of yeasts and bacteria, grown in water with brown sugar.Amongst other microorganisms responsible for the spontaneous fermentation of colonche, a yeast, Torulopsis taboadae (syn. Torulaspora delbrueckii?), has been isolated.\nIn 2003, Te\u00f3filo Herrera Su\u00e1rez, a Mexican mycologist, published a book titled M\u00e1s all\u00e1 del pulque y el tepache (\u201cBeyond pulque and tepache\u201d), in which he writes about traditional Mexican alcoholic beverages such as \u201cpozol\u201d, \u201ctesg\u00fcino\u201d and \u201ccolonche\u201d.",

        "summary": "In general use, herbs are a widely distributed and widespread group of plants, excluding vegetables and other plants consumed for macronutrients, with savory or aromatic properties that are used for flavoring and garnishing food, for medicinal purposes, or for fragrances. Culinary use typically distinguishes herbs from spices. Herbs generally refers to the leafy green or flowering parts of a plant (either fresh or dried), while spices are usually dried and produced from other parts of the plant, including seeds, bark, roots and fruits.\nHerbs have a variety of uses including culinary, medicinal, aromatic and in some cases, spiritual. General usage of the term \"herb\" differs between culinary herbs and medicinal herbs; in medicinal or spiritual use, any parts of the plant might be considered as \"herbs\", including leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, root bark, inner bark (and cambium), resin and pericarp.\nThe word \"herb\" is pronounced  in Commonwealth English, but  is common among American English speakers and those from regions where h-dropping occurs. In Canadian English, both pronunciations are common. In botany, the noun \"herb\" refers to a \"plant that does not produce a woody stem\", and the adjective \"herbaceous\" means \"herb-like\", referring to parts of the plant that are green and soft in texture\".",

While some of these popular iterations of Mexican food are far removed from their Mexican origins, they make up a large portion of the diets of many Americans. Additionally, more traditional Mexican cuisine has become more common in the United States as it further diffuses to regions far from the U.S.-Mexico border.",

        "summary": "Mexican wine and wine making began with the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, when they brought vines from Europe to modern day Mexico, the oldest wine-growing region in the Americas. Although there were indigenous grapes before the Spanish conquest, the Spaniards found that Spanish grapevines also did very well in the colony of New Spain (Mexico) and by the 17th century wine exports from Spain to the New World fell. In 1699, Charles II of Spain prohibited wine making in Mexico, with the exception of wine for Church purposes. From then until Mexico\u2019s Independence, wine was produced in Mexico only on a small scale.After Independence, wine making for personal purposes was no longer prohibited and production rose, especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many other European immigrant groups helped with the comeback of wine in Mexico. However, the Mexican Revolution set back wine production, especially in the north of the country. Wine production in Mexico has been rising in both quantity and quality since the 1980s, although competition from foreign wines and 40% tax on the product makes competing difficult within Mexico. Mexico is not traditionally a wine-drinking country, but rather prefers beer, tequila and mezcal. Interest in Mexican wine, especially in the major cities and tourists areas (along with the introduction into the US on a small scale), has grown along with Mexican wines\u2019 reputation throughout the world. Many Mexican companies have received numerous awards. Various wine producers from Mexico have won international awards for their products. In 2020, the wine Don Leo Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon won gold in the International Cabernet competition (CIDC) and the trophy for the world's best Cabernet. The wine is produced in Parras, Coahuila in the Northwestern region of Mexico.\nThere are three major wine-producing areas in Mexico, with the Baja California area producing 90% of Mexico\u2019s wine. This area is promoted heavily for enotourism with the \u201cRuta del Vino\u201d (Wine Route), which connects over fifty wineries with the port of Ensenada and the border and the annual Vendimia harvest festival.",

        "summary": "Popo is a foamy and cold drink typical in the south of the state of Veracruz and some areas of the state of Oaxaca, like the basin of Papaloapan or Istmo. Its main ingredient is cocoa, which is sweetened with sugar or panela (unrefined brown sugar), and is mixed with water; also azquiote called cocomeca en Oaxaca is added, and/or chupipi, both foaming agents. Some recipes frequently flavor it with cinnamon and/or anise, and they thicken it with maize dough or rice.\nIt is a ceremonial drink, which is prepared for weddings, baptisms, birthdays, patron saint festivals... Its consumption occurs with the cocoa harvest, between the months of August to December. In Ojitl\u00e1n, a type of cocoa called tiger is used for the white veins of its fruits. In the local towns, such as Tuxtepec, it is common to find street vendors offering a glass of popo for $10\u201315 MXN pesos.\nIts name comes from the Nahuatl popocti ([thing] \"that smokes\" or \"that foams\"), according to anthropologist Florent\u00edno Cruz, in reference to the foaming characteristic of this drink. It is compared with Popocat\u00e9petl, which is the \"mountain that smokes\". Popo is strongly linked to indigenous communities, particularly the Nahuas, Mixe-Popolucas, Zoque-Populucas, Mazatecs and Chinatecs. For these communities, the very preparation of the popo is in itself a ritual, which can last up to two days.",

        "summary": "Pulque (Spanish: ['pulke] ; Classical Nahuatl: metoctli), occasionally known as octli or agave wine, is an  alcoholic beverage made from the fermented sap of the maguey (agave) plant. It is traditional in central Mexico, where it has been produced for millennia. It has the color of milk, a rather viscous consistency and a sour yeast-like taste.The drink's history extends far back into the Mesoamerican period, when it was considered sacred, and its use was limited to certain classes of people.  After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the drink became secular and its consumption rose.  The consumption of pulque reached its peak in the late 19th century. In the 20th century, the drink fell into decline, mostly because of competition from beer, which became more prevalent with the arrival of European immigrants; pulque remains popular in many parts of Central Mexico, however, and there have been some efforts to revive the drink's popularity elsewhere through tourism. Similar drinks exist elsewhere in Latin America, such as guarango in Ecuador (see miske).",

Sotol liquor is known as the state spirit of Chihuahua; however, the drink is also consumed in Durango and Coahuila. Sotol has its own appellation of origin since 2002, and may be produced only in Chihuahua, Coahuila and Durango. There are dozens of commercial examples available.\nProduction of sotol spirits exists outside the Sotol Denomination of Origin in several regions such as Sonora where it is known as Palmilla, Oaxaca (Cucharillo), and the Texas Hill Country (Texas Sotol). With Sotol on the rise in terms of its popularity, more brands are beginning to come onto the scene.  \nIt is produced in a manner similar to the more common artisanal mezcals of central Mexico.",

The tamarind plant originated in India but has since been widely distributed on a global scale and is commonly found in tropical regions. The tamarind plant produces fruit pods containing pulp and seeds. Tamarind is a versatile ingredient that is used for a variety of commercial, culinary and medicinal purposes with the pulp being the most commonly used part of the tamarind plant, used in a range of beverages including tamarindo and other similar beverages such as Nam Ma Kham Wan in Thailand and Poha Beer in Ghana. Tamarind pulp offers a flavour that ranges from sour to sweet, making tamarindo a sour-sweet beverage (dependent on the amount of sugar added, as well as on the tamarind cultivar used) recognised as a popular flavour of aguas frescas, which is traditionally consumed in Latin America. Comprising only three ingredients, tamarindo involves a simple production process making it an easy beverage to prepare at home. Tamarindo has been produced commercially as a soda flavour, by companies such as Jarritos and Nestle, and distributed globally.",

In California, Sultana (known there as 'Thompson Seedless') grapes are sometimes diverted from the raisin or table market to produce white juice.Grape juice can be made from all grape varieties after reaching appropriate maturity.

An important exporter of wine in the colonial era between 1912 and 1955, the Moroccan wine industry is experiencing a revival and expansion since the 1990s due to influx of foreign investments.",

The foods that native Africans eat have been influenced by their religions, as well as by their climates and lifestyles. The first Africans to inhabit the continent were hunter-gatherers who ate what they could find in nature. As agriculture became more common in Africa, so did agriculture-based diets.Traditionally, the various cuisines of Africa use a combination of plant-and seed-based ingredients, without having food imported. In some parts of the continent, the traditional diet features an abundance of root tuber products.Central Africa, East Africa, North Africa, Southern Africa and West Africa each have distinctive dishes, preparation techniques, and consumption modes.",

It is colorless and, because it contains sugar, is sweeter than dry anise flavoured spirits (e.g. absinthe). The most traditional style of anisette is that produced by means of distilling aniseed, and is differentiated from those produced by simple maceration by the inclusion of the word distilled on the label. And while Pastis is a similar-tasting liqueur that is prepared in similar fashion and sometimes confused with anisette, it employs a combination of both aniseed and licorice root extracts. Sambuca is essentially an anisette of Italian origin that requires a high minimum (350g/L) sugar content.The liqueur is often mixed with water or poured over ice cubes because of its strong flavour.",

        "summary": "Buddhist cuisine is an Asian cuisine that is followed by monks and many believers from areas historically influenced by Mahayana Buddhism. It is vegetarian or vegan, and it is based on the Dharmic concept of ahimsa (non-violence). Vegetarianism is common in other Dharmic faiths such as Hinduism, Jainism and Sikhism, as well as East Asian religions like Taoism. While monks, nuns and a minority of believers are vegetarian year-round, many believers follow the Buddhist vegetarian diet for celebrations.\nBuddhists believe that cooking is seen as a spiritual practice that produces the nourishment which the body needs to work hard and meditate. The origin of \"Buddhist food\" as a distinct sub-style of cuisine is tied to monasteries, where one member of the community would have the duty of being the head cook and supplying meals that paid respect to the strictures of Buddhist precepts. Temples that were open to visitors from the general public might also serve meals to them and a few temples effectively run functioning restaurants on the premises. In Japan, this culinary custom, recognized as sh\u014djin ry\u014dri (\u7cbe\u9032\u6599\u7406) or devotion cuisine, is commonly offered at numerous temples, notably in Kyoto. This centuries-old culinary tradition, primarily associated with religious contexts, is seldom encountered beyond places like temples, religious festivals, and funerals. A more recent version, more Chinese in style, is prepared by the \u014cbaku school of zen, and known as fucha ry\u014dri (\u666e\u8336\u6599\u7406); this is served at the head temple of Manpuku-ji, as well as various subtemples. In modern times, commercial restaurants have also latched on to the style, catering both to practicing and non-practicing lay people.",

The breakfast cereal proved popular among the patients and Kellogg subsequently started what became the Kellogg Company to produce corn flakes for the wider public. A patent for the process was granted in 1896, after a legal battle between the two brothers.\nWith corn flakes becoming popular in the wider community, a previous patient at the sanitarium, C. W. Post, started to make rival products. Kellogg continued to experiment with various ingredients and different grains. In 1928, he started to manufacture Rice Krispies, another successful breakfast cereal.\nThere are many generic brands of corn flakes produced by various manufacturers. As well as being used as a breakfast cereal, the crushed flakes can be a substitute for bread crumbs in recipes and can be incorporated into many cooked dishes.",

        "summary": "European cuisine comprises the cuisines that originate from the various countries of Europe.The cuisines of European countries are diverse, although there are some common characteristics that distinguish them from those of other regions. Compared with traditional cooking of East Asia, meat is more prominent and substantial in serving size. Many dairy products are utilised in cooking. There are hundreds of varieties of cheese and other fermented milk products. White wheat-flour bread has long been the prestige starch, but historically, most people ate bread, flatcakes, or porridge made from rye, spelt, barley, and oats. Those better-off would also make pasta, dumplings and pastries. The potato has become a major starch plant in the diet of Europeans and their diaspora since the European colonisation of the Americas. Maize is much less common in most European diets than it is in the Americas; however, corn meal (polenta or m\u0103m\u0103lig\u0103) is a major part of the cuisine of Italy and the Balkans. Although flatbreads (especially with toppings such as pizza or tarte flamb\u00e9e) and rice are eaten in Europe, they are only staple foods in limited areas, particularly in Southern Europe.  Salads (cold dishes with uncooked or cooked vegetables, sometimes with a dressing) are an integral part of European cuisine.\nFormal European dinners are served in distinct courses. European presentation evolved from service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise, or bringing multiple dishes to the table at once, into service \u00e0 la russe, where dishes are presented sequentially. Usually, cold, hot and savoury, and sweet dishes are served strictly separately in this order, as hors d'oeuvre (appetizer) or soup, as entr\u00e9e and main course, and as dessert. Dishes that are both sweet and savoury were common earlier in Ancient Roman cuisine, but are today uncommon, with sweet dishes being served only as dessert. A service where the guests are free to take food by themselves is termed a buffet, and is usually restricted to parties or holidays. Nevertheless, guests are expected to follow the same pattern.\nHistorically, European cuisine has been developed in the European royal and noble courts. European nobility was usually arms-bearing and lived in separate manors in the countryside. The knife was the primary eating implement (cutlery), and eating steaks and other foods that require cutting followed. This contrasted with East Asian cuisine, where the ruling class were the court officials, who had their food prepared ready to eat in the kitchen, to be eaten with chopsticks. The knife was supplanted by the spoon for soups, while the fork was introduced later in the early modern period, ca. 16th century. Today, most dishes are intended to be eaten with cutlery and only a few finger foods can be eaten with the hands in polite company.",

        "summary": "Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support. Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin and contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their metabolisms and have evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.\nOmnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems. Humans generally use cooking to prepare food for consumption. The majority of the food energy required is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food through intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems. This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural systems are one of the major contributors to climate change, accounting for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions.The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues, including sustainability, biological diversity, economics, population growth, water supply, and food security. Food safety and security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, the World Resources Institute, the World Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the International Food Information Council.",

Pangasi and other native Filipino alcoholic beverages made from cereal grains were collectively referred to by the Spanish as pitarrillos.Aside from being consumed recreationally, pangasi figured prominently in the rituals of the babaylan shamans in various Filipino ethnic groups. Pangasi was mentioned by early Spanish explorers as being common in the Visayas, though it has largely disappeared throughout most of its range in modern times. It survives in some areas of Visayas and Mindanao.In Panay Island in the Western Visayas, pangasi is traditionally fermented with various leaves as well as sugarcane juice among the Suludnon people. This is very similar to the pangasi (also called agkud) of the Lumad peoples of Mindanao.In the Zamboanga Peninsula, pangasi (more commonly spelled as \"pangase\") refers to three different kinds of wines among the Subanen people of the Zamboanga Peninsula. Traditional pangase is made either from rice or job's tears (adlay) fermented with a starter culture (tapay) and typically spiced with ginger (in modern times, hot peppers are also used). It is fermented inside jars known as bandi or tibod for two weeks to three years. However, modern pangase are increasingly being made with cassava tubers, which was introduced by the Spanish to the Philippines.",

During rolling they are often filled with ground walnuts.  Immediately after baking, they are immersed for a few seconds in cold syrup made of honey and sugar dissolved in water.

These tubers contain a nutritious, starchy polysaccharide called glucomannan. Salep flour is consumed in beverages and desserts, especially in the cuisines of the former Ottoman Empire, notably in the Levant where it is a traditional winter beverage. An increase in consumption is causing local extinctions of orchids in parts of Turkey and Iran.",

        "summary": "Apple cider (also called sweet cider, soft cider, or simply cider) is the name used in the United States and Canada for an unfiltered, unsweetened, non-alcoholic beverage made from apples. Though typically referred to simply as \"cider\" in North America, it is not to be confused with the alcoholic beverage known as cider in other places, which is called \"hard cider\" in the US. Outside of the United States and Canada, it is commonly referred to as cloudy apple juice to distinguish it from clearer, filtered apple juice and hard cider.\nFresh liquid cider is extracted from the whole apple itself, including the apple core, trimmings from apples, and oddly sized or shaped \u201cimperfect\u201d apples, or apple culls. Fresh cider is opaque due to fine apple particles in suspension and generally tangier than commercially cooked and filtered apple juice, but this depends somewhat on the variety of apples used. Cider is sometimes pasteurized or exposed to UV light to kill bacteria and extend its shelf life, but traditional raw untreated cider is still common. Some companies have begun adding preservatives and boiling cider, so that it can be shelf stable and stored without refrigeration. In either form, apple cider is seasonally produced in autumn. It is traditionally served on Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and  New Year's Eve, sometimes heated and mulled.",

        "summary": "Drinking water or potable water is water that is safe for ingestion, either when drunk directly in liquid form or consumed indirectly through food preparation. It is often (but not always) supplied through taps, in which case it is also called tap water. Typically in developed countries, tap water meets drinking water quality standards, even though only a small proportion is actually consumed or used in food preparation. Other typical uses for tap water include washing, toilets, and irrigation. Greywater may also be used for toilets or irrigation. Its use for irrigation however may be associated with risks.The amount of drinking water required to maintain good health varies, and depends on physical activity level, age, health-related issues, and environmental conditions. For those who work in a hot climate, up to 16 litres (4.2 US gal) a day may be required.Globally, by 2015, 89% of people had access to water from a source that is suitable for drinking \u2013 called improved water sources. In sub-Saharan Africa, access to potable water ranged from 40% to 80% of the population. Nearly 4.2 billion people worldwide had access to tap water, while another 2.4 billion had access to wells or public taps. The World Health Organization considers access to safe drinking-water a basic human right.\nAbout 1 to 2 billion people lack safe drinking water. Water can carry vectors of disease. More people die from unsafe water than from war, then-U.N. secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said in 2010. Developing countries are most affected by unsafe drinking water.",

It is distilled in limited quantities and only available for purchase in person. In 1797, urged on by his farm manager, James Anderson, Washington ramped up production and it produced 600 gallons. In 1799, the year Washington died, the distillery produced nearly 11,000 gallons, making it the largest whiskey distillery in America at that time.\nAfter close to a decade of archaeological excavation and reconstruction planning by historians and historical trade interpreters, the building began operation in 2007 using five copper pot stills on the footprints of the original ones. The first batch of whiskey was released in 2010. On March 22, 2017, Governor Terry McAuliffe signed a bill sponsored by Virginia Senator Adam Ebbin (D-30th) designating George Washington's Rye Whiskey as the official state spirit of the Commonwealth of Virginia.",

        "summary": "Kava or kava kava (Piper methysticum: Latin 'pepper' and Latinized Greek 'intoxicating') is a crop of the Pacific Islands. The name kava is from Tongan and Marquesan, meaning 'bitter'; other names for kava include \u02bbawa (Hawai\u02bbi), \u02bbava (Samoa), yaqona or yagona (Fiji), sakau (Pohnpei), seka (Kosrae), and malok or malogu (parts of Vanuatu). Kava is consumed for its sedating effects throughout the Pacific Ocean cultures of Polynesia, including Hawaii and Vanuatu, Melanesia, some parts of Micronesia, such as Pohnpei and Kosrae, and the Philippines.\nThe root of the plant is used to produce a drink with sedative, anesthetic, and euphoriant properties. Its active ingredients are called kavalactones. A systematic review done by the British nonprofit Cochrane concluded it was likely to be more effective than placebo at treating short-term anxiety.Moderate consumption of kava in its traditional form, i.e., as a water-based suspension of kava roots, has been deemed to present an \"acceptably low level of health risk\" by the World Health Organization. However, consumption of kava extracts produced with organic solvents, or excessive amounts of poor-quality kava products, may be linked to an increased risk of adverse health outcomes, including potential liver injury.",

To make the chanh mu\u1ed1i, many limes (often key limes) are packed tightly in salt in a glass container and placed in the sun until they are pickled. During the process, juices are drawn off the limes, which dissolves the salt and produces a pickling liquid which immerses the finished chanh mu\u1ed1i.",

        "summary": "Nelumbo nucifera, also known as sacred lotus, Indian lotus, or simply lotus, is one of two extant species of aquatic plant in the family Nelumbonaceae. It is sometimes colloquially called a water lily, though this more often refers to members of the family Nymphaeaceae.Lotus plants are adapted to grow in the flood plains of slow-moving rivers and delta areas. Stands of lotus drop hundreds of thousands of seeds every year to the bottom of the pond. While some sprout immediately and most are eaten by wildlife, the remaining seeds can remain dormant for an extensive period of time as the pond silts in and dries out. During flood conditions, sediments containing these seeds are broken open, and the dormant seeds rehydrate and begin a new lotus colony.\nUnder favorable circumstances, the seeds of this aquatic perennial may remain viable for many years, with the oldest recorded lotus germination being from seeds 1,300 years old recovered from a dry lakebed in northeastern China. Therefore, the Chinese regard the plant as a symbol of longevity.\nIt has a very wide native distribution, ranging from central and northern India (at altitudes up to 1,400 m or 4,600 ft in the southern Himalayas), through northern Indochina and East Asia (north to the Amur region; the Russian populations have sometimes been referred to as \"Nelumbo komarovii\"), with isolated locations at the Caspian Sea. Today, the species also occurs in southern India, Sri Lanka, virtually all of Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and northern and eastern Australia, but this is probably the result of human translocations. It has a very long history (c. 3,000 years) of being cultivated for its edible seeds and is commonly cultivated in water gardens. It is the national flower of India and Vietnam.",

Ph\u1edf is a popular food in Vietnam where it is served in households, street-stalls, and restaurants country-wide. Residents of the city of Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh were the first to create Vietnamese traditional ph\u1edf. It is considered Vietnam's national dish.Ph\u1edf originated in the early 20th century in Northern Vietnam, and after the Vietnam War, refugees popularized it throughout the world. Because ph\u1edf's origins are poorly documented, there is disagreement over the cultural influences that led to its development in Vietnam, as well as the etymology of the name. The Hanoi (northern) and Saigon (southern) styles of pho differ by noodle width, sweetness of broth, and choice of herbs and sauce.",

        "summary": "Amazake (\u7518\u9152, [amazake]) is a traditional sweet, low-alcohol or non-alcoholic Japanese drink made from fermented rice.  Amazake dates from the Kofun period, and it is mentioned in the Nihon Shoki. It is part of the family of traditional Japanese foods made using the koji mold Aspergillus oryzae (\u9eb9, k\u014dji), which also includes miso, soy sauce, and sake.There are several recipes for amazake that have been used for hundreds of years. By a popular recipe, k\u014dji is added to cooled whole grain rice causing enzymes to break down the carbohydrates into simpler unrefined sugars. As the mixture incubates, sweetness develops naturally. By another recipe, sake kasu is mixed with water and sugar is added.Amazake can be used as a dessert, snack, natural sweetening agent, salad dressing or smoothie. One traditional amazake drink, prepared by combining amazake and water, heated to a simmer, and often topped with a pinch of finely grated ginger, was popular with street vendors, and it is still served at inns, teahouses, and at festivals. Many Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples provide or sell it in the New Year. In the 20th century, an instant version became available.\nAmazake contains many nutrients, including vitamin B1, B2, B6, folic acid, dietary fiber, oligosaccharide, cysteine, arginine and glutamine. It is often considered a hangover cure in Japan. Outside Japan, it is often sold in Asian grocery stores during the winter months, and, all year round, in natural food stores in the U.S. and Europe, as a beverage and natural sweetener.\nSimilar beverages include the Chinese jiuniang and Korean gamju. In grape winemaking, must \u2013 sweet, thick, unfermented grape juice \u2013 is a similar product.",

Instead of the name \u00c4ppler, restaurants and smaller manufacturers may instead call the beverage Schoppen or Schoppe, which actually refers to the measure of the glass. \nIn the Frankfurt area, berries from the service tree (Sorbus domestica) may be added in small quantities to increase astringency, in which case the specific type of Apfelwein is called Speierling.

The drink is made by mixing dates with water and yeast, fermenting the mix, and then distilling it. It is usually drunk neat.During the war in Darfur, a number of southern Sudanese women came to the north as refugees, and found that some of the only professions available to them were prostitution or brewing araqi, the latter being a skill some already had, with a reliable market demand. A 2000 UN report noted that 80% of the women in Khartoum's women's prison were there on charges of prostitution or brewing araqi.Araqi is also popular in South Sudan, which split from Sudan in 2011 and where alcohol is legal.Home distilling can lead to methanol poisoning; 10 died and several others were blinded by a batch of incorrectly distilled araqi in East Darfur in 2017.In 2020, a new law permitted alcohol sales to non-Muslims in Sudan.",

        "summary": "Armagnac (, French: [a\u0281ma\u0272ak]) is a distinctive kind of brandy produced in the Armagnac region in Gascony, southwest France. It is distilled from wine usually made from a blend of grapes including Baco 22A, Colombard, Folle blanche and Ugni blanc, traditionally using column stills rather than the pot stills used in the production of cognac, which is made predominantly from ugni blanc grapes. The resulting spirit is then aged in oak barrels before release. Production is overseen by the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualit\u00e9 (INAO) and the Bureau National Interprofessionel de l'Armagnac (BNIA).\nArmagnac was one of the first areas in France to begin distilling spirits, but the overall volume of production is far smaller than cognac production and therefore is less known outside Europe. In addition, it is for the most part made and sold by small producers, whereas cognac production is dominated by big-name brands, especially Courvoisier (owned by Beam Suntory), Hennessy (LVMH), Martell (Pernod Ricard), and R\u00e9my Martin (R\u00e9my Cointreau).",

It is made from long grain indica rice, and is not a direct product of brewing (like sake) but of distillation (like sh\u014dch\u016b).  The majority of awamori made today uses indica rice imported from Thailand, as the local production is largely insufficient to meet domestic demand, which has risen considerably in recent years.\nAwamori is typically 60\u201386 proof (30\u201343% alcohol), although \"export\" brands (including brands shipped to mainland Japan) are increasingly 50 proof (25% alcohol). Some styles (notably hanazake) are 120 proof (60%) and are flammable.  Awamori is aged in traditional clay pots to improve its flavor and mellowness.\nThe most popular way to drink awamori is with water and ice. When served in a restaurant in Okinawa, it will nearly always be accompanied by a container of ice and carafe of water.  Awamori can also be drunk straight, on the rocks, and in cocktails. Traditionally, awamori was served in a kara-kara, a small earthen vessel with a small clay marble inside. The marble would make a distinctive \"kara-kara\" sound to let people know the vessel was empty. These vessels are still found in Okinawa, but the clay marbles are often absent.\nAnother name for awamori used in Okinawa is \"island sake\" (\u5cf6\u9152, shima-zake), or shima for short.\nIn general, the price of awamori increases with the beverage's age.\nK\u014dr\u0113gusu is a type of hot sauce made of chillis infused in awamori and is a popular condiment to Okinawan dishes such as Okinawa soba.",

        "summary": "Banana wine is a fruit wine made exclusively from bananas. In Tanzania, banana wine is made commercially by fermenting peeled, mashed, ripe bananas and sugar. Water (to dilute the rather thick banana mash), wine yeast and sugar is added to the \"banana mash\".The traditional processing of banana beer is different from that of commercial banana wine. For example, the process of making banana wine used by Banana Investment Ltd. is as follows:\nRipe bananas are peeled and put in plastic barrels filled with water.\nThe barrel contents are then pressed (mashed) and banana mash transferred to large metal pots and boiled for several hours, forming a base of juice and pulp.\nThe boiled banana mash is strained and sugar added to the leftover juice and boiled again.\nThe boiled juice is left to cool.\nWine yeast is added to the cooled, sweetened banana juice and placed in plastic fermentation tanks for 15 to 20 days, depending on product.\nThe fermented liquid is diluted with sterilized water, bottled and then shipped for distribution.In commercial production, Cavendish bananas are used, while in informal production, a variety of cultivars, including both cooking and beer East African Highland bananas, Pisang Awak, Gros Michel, and apple bananas are used. Commercially produced banana wine is a clear, slightly sparkling alcoholic beverage with a longer shelf-life than banana beer, which is spoiled easily and therefore not stored for long periods. Depending on the strain of yeast and amount of sugar added, the sweetness and alcohol level in the final product is variable.Production of banana wine is mostly at a small-scale level, though attempts have been made to bring it up to industrialized production, and there are commercial producers of banana wine (e.g. Arusha-based Banana Investment Ltd). Since the early 2000s, attempts have been made to expand banana wine production to other countries where the crop is prevalent. The Philippine government has sought to expand a local banana wine industry, while India has produced both award-winning banana wines and research into expanding production.",

        "summary": "Bathtub gin refers to any style of homemade spirit made in amateur conditions. The term first appeared in 1920, in the prohibition-era United States, in reference to the poor-quality alcohol that was being made.As gin was the predominant drink in the 1920s, many variations were created by mixing cheap grain alcohol with water and flavorings and other agents, such as juniper berry juice and glycerin. In addition, mixing grain alcohol, water, and flavorings in vessels large enough to supply commercial users had to be small enough for the operation to go undetected by the police. The common metal bathtub in use at the time would have been ideal as would have been a ceramic bathtub, hence the name, 'bathtub gin'. However, since distillation is boiling and condensation in a closed apparatus, and cannot be accomplished in an open vessel such as a bathtub, stories of distilled alcoholic products produced in an open bathtub are likely untrue.\nMany gin cocktails such as Bee's Knees owe their existence to bathtub gin, as they were also created in order to mask the unpleasant taste.",

Additives such as neutral spirits or flavorings are prohibited, except for caramel color.It is a traditional spirit in the German state of Bavaria, where small brewers would convert excess or leftover beer, a perishable good, into a spirit with a longer shelf-life. It can be consumed neat, either chilled or at room temperature, or is sometimes mixed into beer to make a boilermaker. Bierbrand is also occasionally used as an ingredient in Bierlik\u00f6r.\nBierbrand differs from whiskey in that it is not aged in oak barrels, and whiskey is made without hops.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is made by fermenting berries with water. Some varieties also contain rice and reishi mushroom extract.The wine is deep red in color and moderately sweet. The scent of ripe fruit rises, and the sour taste is low. The bitter taste left behind makes it go well with food. Soft tannins irritate the tongue. It ranges between 15% and 19% alcohol by volume, depending on the brand. It is believed to be healthful  and to promote male sexual stamina.Since 2008, South Korean scientists have searched for ways to use bokbunja seeds, which are a by-product of bokbunja-ju production. The carbonized seeds can be used as potential adsorbent for industrial dye removal from wastewaters.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "summary": "Charanda is an alcoholic spirit derived from sugarcane, similar to rum.\nTypically the beverage is associated with the central portion of the State of Michoac\u00e1n in Mexico, particularly the Pur\u00e9pecha-populated areas in the vicinity of the prominently agricultural City of Uruapan. Named after a hill range in the area called 'Cerro de la Charanda' where the first distillery was built in the region. Charanda is a term in Pur\u00e9pecha language meaning 'red-colored soil'.Obtained through the distillation and rectification (double distillation) of sugarcane cold-extracted and then fermented juices. The result is a colorless crystalline spirit. When stored and aged in oak or encino barrels the spirit acquires hues of amber. Certain tonalities of blue are seen in Premium distillations from handpicked sugarcanes when a maceration process is added. Buttery sweet in taste, similar to vanilla. It is usually served at room temperature.\nCharanda was granted protection with a declaration of 'Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen Protegida' in 2003 (in English: Protected Designation of Origin or PDO), following the normatives regarding the quality of the sugarcanes used in the production, the characteristics and types of the final product, as well as the methods of extraction and production. It also norms and specifies the geographical region where the name of the spirit can be used for commercial use.\nCharanda comes in many brands just like any other distilled spirit. Some of the most popular are \"Tres Extra\", \"Tarasco\" (three varieties: Blanco, Reposado and A\u00f1ejo -Premium-), and \"Uruapan\" (three varieties: Blanco, Plata -Premium- and Real de Uruapan -Premium-).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "summary": "Chicha is a fermented (alcoholic) or non-fermented beverage of Latin America, emerging from the Andes and Amazonia regions. In both the pre- and post-Spanish conquest periods, corn beer (chicha de jora) made from a variety of maize landraces has been the most common form of chicha. However, chicha is also made from a variety of other cultigens and wild plants, including, among others, quinoa (Chenopodium quinia), ka\u00f1iwa (Chenopodium pallidicaule), peanut, manioc (also called yuca or cassava), palm fruit, rice, potato, oca (Oxalis tuberosa), and cha\u00f1ar (Geoffroea decorticans). There are many regional variations of chicha. In the Inca Empire, chicha had ceremonial and ritual uses.",

It is very thick and has a milky white color, which is sometimes compared to jade.photo  Fermentation is carried out by a combination of the fungus Aspergillus oryzae, which converts the rice starches into fermentable sugars, and yeast, which converts the sugars into alcohol.  Varieties of lactic acid bacteria are also commonly present in the fermentation starter. The traditional Chinese name of the fermentation starter is q\u016b.\nChoujiu is an ancient variety of Chinese alcoholic beverage. It can be traced back to the Tang Dynasty, where it was praised by the poet Li Bai. In ancient times, choujiu was referred to as l\u00e1ol\u01d0 (\u91aa\u91b4) or y\u00f9ji\u0101ng (\u7389\u6d46).\nIn the modern day, the city of Xi'an is known particularly for its choujiu.\nDoburoku (\u3069\u3076\u308d\u304f / \u6fc1\u9152) is the Japanese equivalent of choujiu, and in Korea gamju and makgeolli are similar.",

The result is a cloudy, pale yellow, moderately alcoholic beverage. Coyol wine is most commonly produced and sold by private vendors, often seen selling the drink on the side of country roads and at small kiosks in used plastic bottles that originally contained water, soft drinks, or other similar beverages.Coyol can also be drunk directly from the hole where it collects in the palm trunk, using a straw or a piece of bamboo.The wine is purportedly unique in that it causes inebriation not primarily by its alcohol content, but through enzymatic action triggered when one drinks it and then receives significant sun exposure. It is popularly claimed that one can become inebriated at night, regain sobriety by the next day, and then undergo inebriation again in the morning without consuming any more, merely by being exposed to the sun again.",

Both Bols and Hiram Walker produce artificially colored red versions of the liqueur (either of which contribute the pink hue to Pink Squirrel cocktails) while Noyau de Poissy from France is available in both clear (blanc) and barrel-aged amber (ambre) versions.\nHistorically, cr\u00e8me de noyaux would contain trace amounts of hydrogen cyanide, which is poisonous. Although the chemical was not normally present in a dangerous intensity, bottles of 19th-century Noyaux left for decades in the cellar would sometimes have all the cyanide float up to the top, with lethal results for the drinker of the first glass. Dorothy Sayers used this peculiarity of the old Cr\u00e8me de Noyaux in her short story \"Bitter Almonds\" (collected in In the Teeth of the Evidence, 1939).\nThe name comes from the French noyau: \"kernel, pit, or core\".  It is an ingredient in the Fairbank cocktail, the Pink Squirrel cocktail and in a cocktail called Old Etonian.In 2013, Tempus Fugit Spirits recreated a 19th-century-style Cr\u00e8me de Noyaux \u2013 distilling both apricot and cherry pits, amongst other botanicals, and coloring the liqueur with red cochineal, as was done in the past. Care was taken to remove the trace elements of hydrogen cyanide produced in the process.\nCr\u00e8me de Noyaux is an ingredient, along with Cr\u00e8me de Cacao and heavy cream or vanilla ice cream in the Pink Squirrel adult beverage.",

A distilled spirit such as brandy, rum, whiskey or bourbon is often a key ingredient.\nThroughout Canada, the United States and some European countries, eggnog is traditionally consumed over the Christmas season, from late October until the end of the holiday season. A variety called ponche crema has been made and consumed in Venezuela and Trinidad since the 1900s, also as part of the Christmas season. During that time, commercially prepared eggnog is sold in grocery stores in these countries.\nEggnog is also homemade using milk, eggs, sugar, and flavorings, and served with cinnamon or nutmeg. While eggnog is often served chilled, in some cases it is warmed, particularly on cold days (similar to the way mulled wine is served warm). Eggnog or eggnog flavoring may also be added to other drinks, such as coffee (e.g., an \"eggnog latte\" espresso drink) and tea, or to dessert foods such as egg-custard puddings.",

As such, geist can be made from a much wider range of materials, as it is not limited to fruits with sufficient fermentable sugars.\nGeist can be produced from a single material (like Himbeergeist) or a combination of multiple ingredients. \nAkvavit, most gins and white absinthes legally meet the description to be considered a geist, although they have more specific legal definitions.",

        "summary": "Ginger wine is a fortified wine often made from a fermented blend of ginger, raisins, sugar and yeast, that is often fortified by being blended with brandy. It is one of the main ingredients of the Whisky Mac cocktail.\nGinger wine originated in England with the foundation of The Finsbury Distilling Company based in the City of London in 1740. The company, like other distillers, was required to build a retail network in compliance with the Gin Act 1751. Joseph Stone, a grocer on High Holborn street, central London, was one of the most prominent and important customers of the Finsbury wines division, and as such, had his name given to their ginger wine.In the 19th century, sales were boosted by a cholera epidemic and a widely held belief that ginger offered protection against the disease, as well as other claims of medicinal properties such as being hailed as an aid to digestion and an effective aphrodisiac.In Scotland, ginger wine is a popular traditional drink during Hogmanay, and a non-alcoholic version is often made for children. Its popularity has led to Crabbie's manufacturing their own version.",

Raspberries have a low sugar content that can only produce a limited amount of alcohol, so Himbeergeist is created by macerating fresh berries in 96% pure neutral spirits. The mixture is then steeped for several weeks to draw out the raspberry essence, distilled, diluted with purified water, and bottled at 37.5% ABV or stronger. Producers may add a small amount of sugar to round off the final taste, but under EU law, this cannot exceed 10 grams of invert sugar per litre. Added colours and flavours are also not permitted.It takes about 17 pounds (7.7 kg) of raspberries to produce one liter of Himbeergeist.",

Home-distilled horilka, moonshine, is called samohon (Ukrainian: \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d, lit.\u2009'self-distillated' or 'self-run' - almost identical to the Russian and Polish samogon). Horilka is usually distilled from grain (usually wheat or rye), though it can, less commonly, also be distilled from potatoes, honey, sugar beets etc. One type of horilka, called pertsivka (Ukrainian: \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0446\u0456\u0432\u043a\u0430), is horilka with chili peppers. Historically, outside Ukraine, pertsivka is generally referred to when people speak of horilka, although pertsivka itself is just one type of horilka.\nIt is believed that horilka was not as strong as today with about 20 percent alcohol by volume (40 proof). However, today nearly all industrially produced horilka is 40 percent (80 proof).",

Its alcohol content is typically 8% to 20%.\nHuangjiu is usually pasteurized, aged and filtered before its final bottling for sale to consumers. Pasteurisation removes impurities as well as stabilising the aromatic flavour compounds. Maturation process can be complicated but important for the development of the layers of flavours and fragrance. A few brands of premium grade huangjiu could have been aged for up to 20 years. Although as huangjiu's name may suggest, its colour is typically light yellow and orange, but it can in fact range from clear to brown. Many famous huangjiu brands use the quality of water involved in the brewing process as a way of advertising, and some consider it to be the most important ingredient.Huangjiu is commonly consumed warm, as the richness from the flavour compounds are released better when warm. In summer, it is popular to drink sweet huangjiu chilled or on ice. Liaojiu (\u6599\u9152) is a type of huangjiu used in cooking, an example of this being the liaojiu-type of Shaoxing rice wine. Major producers of huangjiu include China and Taiwan.",

The production of Korn uses only five grains: most of the production is based on rye or wheat; barley is mainly used to obtain the required malt for the brewing process; oats and buckwheat are rarely used. The addition of food colorings, flavorings, or sweeteners is not permitted. Korn is distilled to lower alcoholic proofs and less rigorously filtered than vodka, which leaves more of the cereal grain flavor in the finished spirit.\nKorn must contain a minimum of 32% ABV (64 proof). Above 37.5% ABV (75 proof) it may be named Kornbrand, and the name Doppelkorn, with 38% ABV (76 proof), has been used in the market.\nKorn is usually consumed neat in shot glasses, but is also popular with a soft drink mixer. In some places, a beer is often ordered together with a Kurzer (\"short\"), i.e., a shot glass of Korn. This combination is called in German a \"Herrengedeck\" (literally \"gentlemen's place-setting\"; English: \"Boilermaker\") in most parts of Germany. Fruit-flavored products made with Korn are available from some Korn manufacturers, though they are sold as liqueurs since Korn itself cannot be flavored.\nVery strong Korn (80% ABV / 160 proof) is known as \"Ansatzkorn\" and is typically used to produce home-made liqueurs from fruits and herbs, such as Zirbenschnaps (liqueur flavoured with stone pine cones); this practice is particularly common in alpine regions. Such liqueurs are usually diluted to drinking strength before bottling. Like other neutral strong spirits, Ansatzkorn can also be used as a disinfectant for domestic use.",

The drink remains important to the peoples of the Central Asian steppes, of Turkic and Mongol origin: Kazakhs, Bashkirs, Kalmyks, Kyrgyz, Mongols, and Yakuts. Kumis was historically consumed by the Khitans, Jurchens, Hungarians, and Han Chinese of North China as well.Kumis is a dairy product similar to kefir, but is produced from a liquid starter culture, in contrast to the solid kefir \"grains\". Because mare's milk contains more sugars than cow's or goat's milk, when fermented, kumis has a higher, though still mild, alcohol content compared to kefir.\nEven in the areas of the world where kumis is popular today, mare's milk remains a very limited commodity. Industrial-scale production, therefore, generally uses cow's milk, which is richer in fat and protein, but lower in lactose than the milk from a horse. Before fermentation, the cow's milk is fortified in one of several ways. Sucrose may be added to allow a comparable fermentation. Another technique adds modified whey to better approximate the composition of mare's milk.",

The first written mention of kvass is found in Primary Chronicle, describing the celebration of Vladimir the Great's baptism in 996. In the traditional method, kvass is made from a mash obtained from rye bread or rye flour and malt soaked in hot water, fermented for about 12 hours with the help of sugar and bread yeast or baker's yeast at room temperature. In industrial methods, kvass is produced from wort concentrate combined with various grain mixtures. It is a popular drink in Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, some parts of Finland, Sweden, and China.",

        "summary": "The legal drinking age is the minimum age at which a person can legally consume alcoholic beverages. The minimum age alcohol can be legally consumed can be different from the age when it can be purchased in some countries. These laws vary between countries and many laws have exemptions or special circumstances. Most laws apply only to drinking alcohol in public places with alcohol consumption in the home being mostly unregulated (one of the exceptions being England and Wales, which have a minimum legal age of five for supervised consumption in private places). Some countries also have different age limits for different types of alcohol drinks.\nThe majority of countries have a minimum legal drinking age of 18. The most commonly known reason for the law behind the legal drinking age is the effect on the brain in adolescents. Since the brain is still maturing, alcohol can have a negative effect on the memory and long-term thinking. Alongside that, it can cause liver failure, and create a hormone imbalance in teens due to the constant changes and maturing of hormones during puberty. Some countries have a minimum legal drinking age of 19 to prevent the flow of alcoholic beverages in high schools, while others like the United States have a minimum legal purchasing age of 21 (18 in P.R. and USVI) in an effort to reduce the amount of drunk driving rates among teenagers and young adults.",

In Greece, mastiha (Greek: \u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c7\u03b1) or mastichato (Greek: \u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c7\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf) is a sweet liqueur produced with the mastika resin from the Greek island of Chios, which is distilled after hardening to crystals. Sugar is typically added. It is a sweet liqueur that is typically consumed at the end of a meal. It has a distinctive flavor, reminiscent of pine and herbs. It is claimed to have medicinal properties and to aid digestion.In August of 2012, wildfires spread across the island of Chios, scorching 31,480 acres (12,740 ha) and destroying more than half of the island's mastic orchards. Because the product has a \"protected designation of origin\" from the European Union, the fire not only impacted local Chios farmers, who lost approximately 60 percent of their crops, but also derailed the global supply of the product.",

        "summary": "Mead (), also called hydromel (particularly when low in alcohol content), is an alcoholic beverage made by fermenting honey mixed with water, and sometimes with added ingredients such as fruits, spices, grains, or hops. The alcoholic content ranges from about 3.5% ABV to more than 20%. The defining characteristic of mead is that the majority of the beverage's fermentable sugar is derived from honey. It may be still, carbonated, or naturally sparkling; dry, semi-sweet, or sweet.Mead that also contains spices is called metheglin (), and mead that contains fruit is called melomel. The term honey wine is sometimes used as a synonym for mead, although wine is typically defined to be the product of fermented grapes or certain other fruits, and some cultures have honey wines that are distinct from mead. The honey wine of Hungary, for example, is the fermentation of honey-sweetened pomace of grapes or other fruits.Mead was produced in ancient times throughout Europe, Africa, and Asia, and has played an important role in the mythology of some peoples. In Norse mythology, for example, the Mead of Poetry, crafted from the blood of Kvasir (a wise being born from the mingled spittle of the Aesir and Vanir deities) would turn anyone who drank it into a poet or scholar.",

        "summary": "The Aguardente de Medronhos is a strong spirit, a traditional fruit brandy from Portugal, obtained from arbutus berries - the fruit of the Medronho tree, Arbutus unedo - also called strawberry tree. The Arbutus unedo grow wild on the poor soils in rural regions of Portugal such as Lous\u00e3 and the inner Algarve (in such places like Marmelete and S\u00e3o Marcos da Serra).\nThere was no large-scale commercial plantation of Arbutus unedo until the 21st century and in the past the arbutus berries were mainly collected by local farmers, by hand and processed privately. Therefore, good Aguardente de Medronhos was not easily found in supermarkets but instead bought mostly directly from these farmers. Very few farmers had a license for distillation, but they were tolerated by the authorities to keep this traditional Portuguese specialty alive.\nA commercial derivative, sweetened with honey and flavoured with herbs, is sold under the brand names Brandymel and Dom Cristina.Aguardente de Medronhos is also known as 'firewater' to non-Portuguese speakers. It is a rough translation from \u00e1gua ardente, which is Portuguese for burning water. The spirit obtains this name from the hot sensation as the consumed beverage travels down the throat and is felt through the sinuses.\nThe alcohol content of the beverage can vary; however, many bottles of Aguardente de Medronhos contain around 48% alcohol by volume. The beverage is consumed in shot-glass sized portions.",

        "summary": "Rectified spirit, also known as neutral spirits, rectified alcohol or ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin, is highly concentrated ethanol that has been purified by means of repeated distillation in a process called rectification. In some countries, denatured alcohol or denatured rectified spirit may commonly be available as \"rectified spirit\", because in some countries (though not necessarily the same) the retail of rectified alcohol in its non-denatured form is prohibited.\nThe purity of rectified spirit has a practical limit of 97.2% ABV (95.6% by mass) when produced using conventional distillation processes, as a mixture of ethanol and water becomes a minimum-boiling azeotrope at this concentration. However, rectified spirit is typically distilled in continuous multi-column stills at 96\u201396.5% ABV and diluted as necessary. Ethanol is a commonly used medical alcohol\u200a\u2014\u200aspiritus fortis is a medical term for ethanol solutions with 95% ABV.\nNeutral spirits can be produced from grains, corn, grapes, sugar beets, sugarcane, tubers, or other fermentable materials such as whey. In particular, large quantities of neutral alcohol are distilled from wine and by-products of wine production (pomace, lees). A product made from grain is \"neutral grain spirit\", while a spirit made from grapes is called \"grape neutral spirit\" or \"vinous alcohol\". These terms are commonly abbreviated as either GNS or NGS.Neutral spirits are used in the production of several spirit drinks, such as blended whisky, cut brandy, most gins, some liqueurs and some bitters. As a consumer product, it is almost always mixed with other beverages to create drinks like alcoholic punch or Jello shots or is sometimes added to cocktails in place of vodka or rum. It is also used to make home made liqueurs, such as limoncello or Cr\u00e8me de cassis, and in cooking because its high concentration of alcohol acts as a solvent to extract flavors. Rectified spirits are also used for medicinal tinctures and as a household solvent. They are sometimes consumed undiluted; however, because the alcohol is so high-proof, overconsumption can cause alcohol poisoning more quickly than more traditional distilled spirits.",

It is also known as nihamanci, nijimanche, or nijiamanchi, and is related to chicha.J\u00edvaro women make it by chewing manioc tubers, placing them in large jars, and allowing them to ferment in their saliva. Nijimanche is nutrious, and adults drink 4\u20135 quarts a day.The same beverage is made by the Jivaro in Ecuador and Peru (the Shuara, Achuara, Aguaruna and Mayna people); they call it nijimanche. As Michael Harner describes it:\n\nThe sweet manioc beer (nihamanci or nijiamanchi), is prepared by first peeling and washing the tubers in the stream near the garden. Then the water and manioc are brought to the house, where the tubers are cut up and put in a pot to boil. ... The manioc is then mashed and stirred to a soft consistency with the aid of a special wooden paddle. While the woman stirs the mash, she chews handfuls  [sic] of [it] and spits them back into the pot, a process that may take half an hour or longer.After the mash has been prepared, it is transferred to a beer storage jar and left to ferment. ... The resultant liquid tastes somewhat like a pleasingly alcoholic buttermilk and is most refreshing. The Jivaros consider it to be far superior to plain water, which they drink only in emergencies.The Tiri\u00f3s and Erwarhoyanas, Indian tribes from northern Brazil and Suriname, make a beverage called sakur\u00e1 with the sweet variety of cassava.Yagua people brew a similar beverage which they called masato.",

Chemically, the heat changes the starch in the root to a fermentable sugar. The baked root is then soaked in a vat of water which dissolves the sugar, and fermentation begins. The fermented drink was later distilled into a highly alcoholic spirit which became Hawaii's only indigenous distilled spirit, and was prized by the king. The Merrie Monarch, King David Kalakaua, is said to have had his own distiller.",

It is widely sold in open markets and mostly associated with rural areas and northern Namibia. Oshikundu can be served with porrige also when there is nothing to eat with porrige with it aid in term of in need of beef or soup.\nThe combination is left to ferment for several hours at room temperature. Once Oshikundu is ready to drink it becomes brown with a thick texture. It is nutritious and has a short shelf life, it is usually a home-brewed drink and it is enjoyed every day.A study carried out in 2001 by the Department of Food Science at the University of Namibia revealed that it was possible to produce a dry mix containing malted pearl millet and sorghum, that would be nutritionally enhanced with bambara nut. This mix could then be sold for making oshikundu.",

        "summary": "Parakari is a fermented alcoholic beverage made by Amerindians of Guyana and Venezuela. Like other cassava alcoholic beverages, parakari is made by dual fermenting cassava (a large starchy root), which involves the use of an amylolytic mold (Rhizopus sp., Mucoraceae, Zygomycota) by chewing it.\nParakari is produced by Pemon, Wapishana, Macushi, Patamona tribes, and production was observed among the Wai-wai, but is said to have ceased due to Christian missionary suppression. For the Makushi tribe, parakari making and drinking are an important part of group cohesion and cultural identity.In a study of the production process in a Wapisiana village, thirty steps were involved in parakari manufacture, including the use of specific cassava varieties, control of culture temperature and boosting of Rhizopus inoculum potential with purified starch additives. The cassava contains high amounts of cyanide and can be deadly if not prepared properly.\nTo prepare parakari, cassava root is grated and placed in a long, woven strainer to drain out the juice of the cassava. Toxins are rinsed out and the resulting flour is made into bread. The bread used to make parakari is deliberately overcooked, as burning lends the drink its characteristic taste. This bread is then soaked in water, broken up, and placed in a bed of leaves. A powder of dried cassava leaves containing the Rhizopus inoculum is added as well as tapioca starch and dried cassava slices that encourage fermentation. The bread is removed after a number of days and placed a vessel for further fermentation, in which a shorter time will yield a sweeter drink, and a longer time a more bitter, alcoholic drink. This second fermentation can take between 1 day to 5 weeks.Sarawi is another cassava-based beverage made by the Wapisiana tribe.",

        "summary": "Pruno, also known as \u201chooch\u201d or prison wine, is an alcoholic beverage variously made from apples, oranges, fruit cocktail, fruit juices, hard candy, sugar, high fructose syrup, and possibly other ingredients, including crumbled bread. Bread is incorrectly thought to contain yeast for the pruno to ferment. Pruno originated in (and remains largely confined to) prisons, where it can be produced with the limited selection of equipment and ingredients available to inmates. It can be made using only a plastic bag, hot running water, and a towel or sock to conceal the pulp during fermentation. The end result has been colorfully described as a \"bile flavored wine-cooler\". Depending on the time spent fermenting (always balanced against the risk of discovery by officers), the sugar content, and the quality of the ingredients and preparation, pruno's alcohol content by volume can range from as low as 2% (equivalent to a very weak beer) to as high as 14% (equivalent to a strong wine).",

        "summary": "In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, p\u00e1lenka is any kind of distilled beverage but especially fruit brandy. The term is often used generically for all kinds of liquors, including vodka, gin and borovi\u010dka. The word derives from the Slavic verb *paliti (Czech: p\u00e1lit, Slovak: p\u00e1li\u0165) 'to burn; to distill'.\nSimilar products exist in Hungary under the name p\u00e1linka and in Romania under the name palinc\u0103. The product is also often compared to Rakia, a spirit found throughout much of the Balkans. \nMost traditional types of p\u00e1lenka in Moravia and Slovakia are slivovica (plum spirit), ra\u017en\u00e1 (grain spirit), borovi\u010dka (a special kind of liquor distilled from the berries of Juniperus communis), hru\u0161kovica (pear spirit), jablkovica (apple spirit). Popular are also \u010dere\u0161\u0148ovica (cherry spirit) and marhu\u013eovica (apricot spirit). Very distinctive among p\u00e1lenkas are the ones distilled from fermented forest berries, including raspberries, blueberries, wild black thorn (plan\u00e1 trnka) and cranberries. Drienkovica (a spirit distilled from Cornelian cherries (Cornus mas) was popularized by the former Slovak president Rudolf Schuster.\nLess common now but historically popular distillates include je\u0159abinka (made from Rowan berries) and kontu\u0161ovka (made from vodka, and flavoured with star anise and other spices, and sweetened with honey). The latter was quite popular prior to the First World War, and features prominently in the works of Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek, Petr Bezru\u010d and Sigmund Freud.It was the title of a 2014 award-winning novel by Mat\u011bj Ho\u0159ava, about a Czech-speaking minority community in a village in Romania in Banat.",

In some examples, the hops presence is pushed to the point where they resemble American India pale ales (IPAs).  This style is often called a Rye IPA, or \"Rye-P-A\".\nFinnish sahti is produced by brewing rye with juniper berries and baker's yeast\nThe traditional Slavic kvass is made using rye bread that has been steeped and fermented.",

        "summary": "Sahti is a Finnish type of farmhouse ale made from malted and unmalted grains including barley and rye. Traditionally the beer is flavored with juniper in addition to, or instead of, hops; the mash is filtered through juniper twigs into a trough-shaped tun, called a kuurna in Finnish. Sahti is top-fermented and many have a banana flavor due to isoamyl acetate from the use of baking yeast, although ale yeast may also be used in fermenting.\nThe end product is a cloudy beer with  phenolic flavors and a distinct taste similar to banana, balanced by the bitterness from the juniper branches. The carbonation level tends to be very low. Sahti was traditionally brewed as a farmhouse ale, but commercial versions are now available. Commercial sahti is usually 8% ABV. In Finland, due to the higher percentage of alcohol in sahti, it is only sold in commercial sahti breweries, pubs or state-owned Alko stores, not in regular markets or grocery stores. Sahti has to be stored cold until consumption and is therefore not available in all Alko branches.\nWithin Finland, sahti has differing characteristics depending on which part of the country it is from. It is often known as Tavastian beer from H\u00e4me (well-known sahti areas, such as Sysm\u00e4, Joutsa, Kuhmoinen and Lammi, are in H\u00e4me) but it is also made in Finland Proper and some parts of Central Finland. Every year the Finnish sahti brewing championship is held on the first weekend in August.",

        "summary": "Sake or sak\u00e9 (\u9152, sake,  SAH-kee, SAK-ay), also referred to as Japanese rice wine, is an alcoholic beverage of Japanese origin made by fermenting rice that has been polished to remove the bran. Despite the name Japanese rice wine, sake, and indeed any East Asian rice wine (such as huangjiu and cheongju), is produced by a brewing process more akin to that of beer, where starch is converted into sugars that ferment into alcohol, whereas in wine, alcohol is produced by fermenting sugar that is naturally present in fruit, typically grapes.\nThe brewing process for sake differs from the process for beer, where the conversion from starch to sugar and then from sugar to alcohol occurs in two distinct steps. Like other rice wines, when sake is brewed, these conversions occur simultaneously. The alcohol content differs between sake, wine, and beer; while most beer contains 3\u20139% ABV, wine generally contains 9\u201316% ABV, and undiluted sake contains 18\u201320% ABV (although this is often lowered to about 15% by diluting with water before bottling).\nIn Japanese, the character sake (kanji: \u9152, Japanese pronunciation: [sake]) can refer to any alcoholic drink, while the beverage called sake in English is usually termed nihonshu (\u65e5\u672c\u9152; meaning 'Japanese alcoholic drink'). Under Japanese liquor laws, sake is labeled with the word seishu (\u6e05\u9152; 'refined alcohol'), a synonym not commonly used in conversation.\nIn Japan, where it is the national beverage, sake is often served with special ceremony, where it is gently warmed in a small earthenware or porcelain bottle and sipped from a small porcelain cup called a sakazuki. As with wine, the recommended serving temperature of sake varies greatly by type.\nSake now enjoys an international reputation. Of the more than 800 junmai ginj\u014d-shu evaluated by Robert Parker's team, 78 received a score of 90 or more (eRobertParker, 2016).",

It is prepared by sweetening and flavoring various types of distillate alcohol with herbs and spices; thus the name tentura which comes from the Italian word tinctura ('tincture'). Brandy from Patras' wineries is the most common alcoholic base for tentura, though sometimes rum or grain alcohol are used as well. The fermented essences of cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, and citrus fruits are the most common flavoring agents. These aromatic ingredients give tentura its distinctive dark orange-red color and its alternative local name \u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03c7\u03bf\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae\u03b8\u03c1\u03b1 (moschovolithra, lit.\u2009'she who throws scent'). It has an alcohol content of around 25% by volume.It is most often served chilled or over ice in a small glass after a large meal as a digestif. It is also added to espresso coffee, which is then called espresso corretto. It is also served at room temperature.\n\n\n== References ==",

Tsikoudia is made by distilling of pomace, what remains of grapes pressed in winemaking. The pomace ferments for about six weeks in a tightly sealed barrel, and is then distilled. \nIt is similar to tsipouro from mainland Greece, the rak\u0131 family, as well as Albanian: rakia, Spanish: orujo, Italian: grappa, French: marc, Georgian: chacha, Portuguese: bagaceira, Bulgarian: \u0440\u0430\u043a\u0438\u044f, romanized: rakiya, Macedonian: \u0440\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0458\u0430, romanized: rakija, Serbo-Croatian: rakija / \u0440\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0458\u0430 (in Istria: grappa), Romanian: tescovin\u0103, Hungarian: t\u00f6rk\u00f6ly. In the eastern part of Crete tsikoudia is commonly referred to as raki, but apparently less so in the west.\nIt is often produced at home in villages throughout Crete, thus the alcohol content varies by producer. Typically each Cretan village has one or two residents who are licensed to distill, and tsikoudia is produced continuously for two to three weeks in late October and early November.\nTsikoudia is sometimes served cold from a bottle kept in a freezer. This is commonly offered as an after dinner digestif, and in most tavernas in Crete it is offered as a complimentary digestif with fruits and sweets after the meal.\nIt can be flavored using lemon rind, rosemary, or honey (rakomelo).\n\n\n== Notes ==",

It is sometimes mixed with green tea (o-cha-wari) or warm water (o-yu-wari). Umeshu can be served at different temperatures; chilled or with ice, room temperature, or even hot in the winter.\nUmeshu can be made either from real plum fruit, or using additive flavours and perfumes to emulate the taste of plums. Umeshu which is made from exclusively plum fruit (without additives) will be labelled as Honkaku Umeshu and will typically be made only from ume fruit, sugar, and alcohol.",

        "summary": "Unicum (pronounced [\u02c8unikum]) is a Hungarian herbal liqueur or bitters, drunk as a digestif and ap\u00e9ritif. The liqueur was created in 1790 and is today produced by Zwack according to a secret formula of more than forty herbs; the drink is aged in oak casks. During communism in Hungary, the Zwack family lived in exile in New York City and Chicago, and Unicum in Hungary was produced using a different formula. Before moving to the United States, J\u00e1nos Zwack had entrusted a family friend in Milan with the production of Unicum based on the original recipe. After the fall of communism, P\u00e9ter Zwack returned to Hungary and resumed production of the original Unicum.\nThe texture of the drink is \"thick, black, goopy\" and so bitter that it is often described as an acquired taste.  The drink's name originates from the words of Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, who in 1790, when being given the drink, said (in German) \"Das ist ein Unikum!\" (\"This is unique!\").Unicum is regarded as one of the national drinks of Hungary. The production facility offers tours which include a tasting session of the multiple different varieties including Unicum and Unicum Plum. According to the manufacturer, the original Unicum is no longer distributed in the United States, having been replaced by Unicum Next (a sweeter, thinner-bodied drink with a more prominent citrus flavour), re-branded as \"Zwack\".",

Orzo is a caffeine-free roasted grain beverage made from ground barley (orzo in Italian, from Latin hordeum). It is an espresso-style drink, and when prepared from the roasted barley directly, it can easily be made in typical espresso machines and coffeemakers. In Italy it is widely available in coffee vending machines and traditionally considered a coffee substitute for children.In Italy caff\u00e8 d'orzo is made in traditional Italian espresso machines in cafes. Italian families tend, instead, to make it using an orziera, a special moka pot adapted to barley.During World War II and in the post-war era, caff\u00e8 d'orzo and chicory became popular substitutes for coffee, which was expensive due to rationing and food shortages. In European countries with a very long post-war period, like for instance Spain, this image of barley as a cheap surrogate of coffee still remains in the memory of the population. In Italy there are dozens of roasters making caff\u00e8 d'orzo and it is a very popular drink. Outside of Italy the consumption of caff\u00e8 d'orzo as a healthy drink is also increasing slowly, especially in Germany.A variety called caf\u00e9 de cebada (\"coffee of barley\") in Spanish and simply Cevada in Portuguese is available in Latin American markets, though it is often more of a roasted barley tea than a coffee-like beverage. Instant roasted barley drinks are sold under various brand names (although most of them are made with a mix of cereals, not only barley) such as Caro (Europe, New Zealand), Pero (Switzerland, US), Barleycup (UK) and Ecco (Chile), among others.",

        "summary": "A malt drink is a fermented drink in which the primary ingredient is the grain, or seed, of the barley plant, which has been allowed to sprout slightly in a traditional way called \"malting\" before it is processed.\nBy far the most predominant malt drink is beer (naturally fermented barley sugars flavoured with hops), of which there are two main styles: ale and lager. A low alcohol level drink brewed in this fashion is technically identical to \"non-alcoholic beer\". Such a drink may be prepared by using a slightly altered brewing process that yields negligible alcohol (technically less than 0.5% by volume). These are called low-alcohol beers or \"near beers\".\nIn the United States, the term \"malt beverage\" may be used by trade associations of groups of beer wholesalers (e.g. Tennessee Malt Beverages Association) for the sake of a professional image by using brewing craft related terms, for political or legal reasons, or to avoid potential negative connotations that may be associated with beer in a region.  Additionally, the term malt beverage is applied to many other flavoured drinks prepared from malted grains to which natural or artificial flavours (and sometimes colours) have been added to make them taste and appear similar to wines, fruits, colas, natural ciders, or other drinks. This subcategory has been called \"malternative\", as in Smirnoff Ice (US and French version), or \"maltini\", as in 3SUM, which also has energy components like caffeine. Marketing of such products in the United States has increased rapidly in recent years. In most jurisdictions, these products are regulated in a way identical to beer, which allows a retailer with a beer license to sell a wider product line. This also generally avoids the steeper taxes and stricter regulations associated with distilled spirits.",

        "summary": "Plant milk is a plant beverage with a color resembling that of milk. Plant milks are non-dairy beverages made from a water-based plant extract for flavoring and aroma. Plant milks are consumed as alternatives to dairy milk, and may provide a creamy mouthfeel.As of 2021, there are about 17 different types of plant milks; almond, oat, soy, coconut, and pea are the highest-selling worldwide. Production of plant-based milks, particularly soy, oat, and pea milks, can offer environmental advantages over animal milks in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, land and water use.Plant-based beverages have been consumed for centuries, with the term \"milk-like plant juices\" used since the 13th century. In the 21st century, they are commonly referred to as plant-based milk, alternative milk, non-dairy milk or vegan milk. For commerce, plant-based beverages are typically packaged in containers similar and competitive to those used for dairy milk, but cannot be labeled as \"milk\" within the European Union.Across various cultures, plant milk has been both a beverage and a flavor ingredient in sweet and savory dishes, such as the use of coconut milk in curries. It is compatible with vegetarian and vegan lifestyles. Plant milks are also used to make ice cream alternatives, plant cream, vegan cheese, and yogurt-analogues, such as soy yogurt. The global plant milk market was estimated to reach US$62 billion by 2030.",

        "summary": "Lithia water is defined as a type of mineral water characterized by the presence of lithium salts (such as the carbonate, chloride, or citrate of lithium). Natural lithia mineral spring waters are rare, and there are few commercially bottled lithia water products.\nBetween the 1880s and World War I, the consumption of bottled lithia mineral water was popular. One of the first commercially sold lithia waters in the United States was bottled at Lithia Springs, Georgia, in 1888. During this era, there was such a demand for lithia water that there was a proliferation of bottled lithia water products. However, only a few were natural lithia spring waters. Most of the bottled lithia water brands added lithium bicarbonate to spring water and called it lithia water. With the start of World War I and the formation of the new US government food safety agency, mineral water bottlers were under scrutiny. The new agency posted large fines against mineral water bottlers for mislabeled, misrepresented and adulterated products. These government actions and their publicity, along with public works that made clean tap water readily accessible, caused the American public to lose confidence and interest in bottled mineral water.Lithia water contains various lithium salts, including lithium citrate. An early version of Coca-Cola available in pharmacies' soda fountains called Lithia Coke was a mixture of Coca-Cola syrup and Bowden lithia spring water. The soft drink 7Up was named \"Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda\" when it was formulated in 1929 because it contained lithium citrate. The beverage was a patent medicine marketed as a cure for hangover. Lithium citrate was removed from 7Up in 1948.",

The artesian springs in the valley are fed by water that filters from glaciers covering the peaks of the Bakuriani mountains at altitudes of up to 2,300 m (7,500 ft). The water rises to the surface without pumping and is transported by pipes to two bottling plants in the town of Borjomi.The mineral springs of the Borjomi valley were known to locals for over a thousand years but did not reach wider recognition until the early 1800s, after the Russian Imperial Army stationed in the area became aware of the water's salubrious effects. By the 1890s, Borjomi had become famous throughout the Russian Empire, had earned the favor of the Russian imperial dynasty of Romanov and was being bottled in the Georgian estates of Grand Duke Mikhail of Russia. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 and subsequent Soviet takeover of Georgia, the Borjomi enterprise was nationalized and the water was made into a top Soviet export.Currently, Borjomi is produced by IDS Borjomi Georgia, which is part of IDS Borjomi International. In June 2022, the controlling company of IDS Borjomi International had to relinquish some of its shares to the Government of Georgia as part of a deal to comply with international sanctions. As a result, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of IDS Borjomi International became the representative of the Georgian government.In 2005, the production of Borjomi reached 200 million bottles. In 2007, the international certification company Bureau Veritas granted Borjomi the international certificate of production safety and quality ISO 22000. Today, Borjomi is exported to 40 countries of the world.The use of Borjomi water has been suggested by the Georgian and Russian researchers for complex treatment of several digestive diseases and diabetes mellitus.",

        "summary": "Canned water is drinking water, including spring water, artesian spring water, purified water, carbonated water and mineral water, packaged in beverage cans made of aluminium or tin-plated steel.Individual serving aluminium cans and bottles are less common alternatives to bottled water.  Canned water is often used where storage or distribution systems are set up for cans. Some companies have launched water in cans, offering a more environmentally sustainable alternative to plastic bottles.\nCans of various sizes are also used for storage of potable water for emergency preparedness. Water is an important part of individual or government stockpiles. Water was stored in steel cans, lined with plastic bags, under the United States Civil Defense program. Approximately twelve million 17.5-US-gallon (66 L) cans were deployed, and could hold water for more than ten years.Later, some manufacturers started to use a nitrogen flush to remove air and bacteria from their cans to prolong shelf life to 30 years or longer, making the water suitable for long-term storage.\n\nPlastic bottled water is known to have negative environmental consequences. It is estimated that only about 9% of all plastic is recycled. About 79% of this plastic waste is disposed of in landfills, incinerated and littered, which results in some plastic entering waterways. In contrast, up to 65% of all aluminium cans are recycled, making aluminium cans the most recycled beverage container on the planet. Due to the detrimental impact of plastic on the environment, many manufacturers are turning towards aluminium cans and glass bottles as a more sustainable solution to packaged drinking water. \n\n\n== References ==",

Darius Bikoff with an electrolyte enhanced line of water called Smartwater, Energy Brands initially distributed its products to health food stores and independent retailers in the New York area. Adding Fruitwater and Vitaminwater to its line in 1998 and 2000, respectively, the company expanded to nationwide distribution in the early 2000s.\nBy 2002, the Glac\u00e9au line of waters was the top-selling enhanced water brand in the United States, with the company's Vitaminwater being its best-selling product. In 2006, the company earned US$350 million in revenue. The company then began its global expansion, launching its products in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2008, France in 2009 and Argentina in 2011.\nEnergy Brands is owned primarily by Bikoff, employees, and small investors. Rapper 50 Cent obtained a minority share of the company as part of an endorsement deal in the company. Thirty percent of the equity was sold to LVMH sometime in the 2000s, which in turn sold those shares. The shares eventually were sold to India-based Tata Group in August 2006, which held the shares until May 2007 when The Coca-Cola Company purchased the company as an independent subsidiary, leaving its actual operations with its existing management including Bikoff.",

        "summary": "Special K is an American brand of breakfast cereal and meal bars originally manufactured by Kellogg's. The cereal was introduced to the United States in 1955. It is made primarily from grains such as lightly toasted rice, wheat and barley. Special K used to be marketed primarily as a low-fat cereal that can be eaten to help one lose weight. Following the 2023 spinoff of Kellogg's North American cereal division, the cereal is manufactured by WK Kellogg Co for the United States, Canada, and Caribbean markets. The former Kellogg's, renamed Kellanova, continues to manufacture the cereal for the rest of the world and the meal bars for all markets.",

The water is a natural spring water from the  hills that consist of very hard granite rock. Fissures in the rock retain rain water, which slowly permeates through, escaping at the springs. The springs release an average of about 60 litres a minute. The flow rate depends on rainfall and can vary from as little as 36 litres (8 gallons) per minute to over 350 litres (77 gallons) per minute.Schweppes began bottling the water on a commercial scale in 1850 and it was first  offered for sale at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Since the owners, Coca-Cola Enterprises, closed their Colwall plant in  November 2010, Malvern Water is now exclusively bottled on  a smaller scale by the family-owned Holywell Water Company Ltd under the name Holywell Malvern Spring Water who offer the water in still and sparkling (carbonated) versions.",

Combinations of a number of these processes have come into use to produce ultrapure water of such high purity that its trace contaminants are measured in parts per billion (ppb) or parts per trillion (ppt). \nPurified water has many uses, largely in the production of medications, in science and engineering laboratories and industries, and is produced in a range of purities. It is also used in the commercial beverage industry as the primary ingredient of any given trademarked bottling formula, in order to maintain product consistency. It can be produced on-site for immediate use or purchased in containers. Purified water in colloquial English can also refer to water that has been treated (\"rendered potable\") to neutralize, but not necessarily remove contaminants considered harmful to humans or animals.",

        "summary": "A spring is a natural exit point at which groundwater emerges out of the aquifer and flows onto the top of the Earth's crust (pedosphere) to become surface water. It is a component of the hydrosphere, as well as a part of the water cycle. Springs have long been important for humans as a source of fresh water, especially in arid regions which have relatively little annual rainfall.\nSprings are driven out onto the surface by various natural forces, such as gravity and hydrostatic pressure. A spring produced by the emergence of geothermally heated groundwater is known as a hot spring. The yield of spring water varies widely from a volumetric flow rate of nearly zero to more than 14,000 litres per second (490 cu ft/s) for the biggest springs.",

Due to its relatively high content of hydrogen carbonate, it can neutralize excessive acid in the stomach. The spring is located in Lahn valley north of Wiesbaden, close to the eastern boundary of Nassau natural preserve.\nThe company is headquartered in Fachingen/Lahn and has been part of Mineralbrunnen \u00dcberkingen-Teinach AG since 1990. Staatlich indicates that the spring was state-owned until this 1990 sale (previous owner: Rhineland-Palatinate). In 2001, Karlsberg acquired controlling interest in the Mineralbrunnen \u00dcberkingen-Teinach company from Nestl\u00e9, including Afri-Cola and the mineral water brands Staatlich Fachingen and Hirschquelle.Since 2008, Staatl.

It is commonly located near the restroom due to closer access to plumbing. A drain line is also provided from the water cooler into the sewer system.\nWater dispensers come in a variety of form factors, ranging from wall-mounted to bottle filler water dispenser combination units, to bi-level units and other formats. They are generally broken up into two categories: point-of-use (POU) water dispensers and bottled water dispensers. POU water dispensers are connected to a water supply, while bottled water dispensers require delivery (or self-pick-up) of water in large bottles from vendors. Bottled water dispensers can be top-mounted or bottom-loaded, depending on the design of the model.\nBottled water dispensers typically use 11- or 22-liter (5- or 10-gallon) dispensers commonly found on top of the unit. Pressure coolers are a subcategory of water dispensers encompassing drinking water fountains and direct-piping water dispensers. Water cooler may also refer to a primitive device for keeping water cool.",

        "summary": "Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by the Coca-Cola Company. In 2013, Coke products were sold in over 200 countries worldwide, with consumers drinking more than 1.8 billion company beverage servings each day. Coca-Cola ranked No. 87 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. Based on Interbrand's \"best global brand\" study of 2020, Coca-Cola was the world's sixth most valuable brand.Originally marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine, Coca-Cola was invented in the late 19th century by John Stith Pemberton in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1888, Pemberton sold the ownership rights to Asa Griggs Candler, a businessman, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the global soft-drink market throughout the 20th and 21st century. The name refers to two of its original ingredients: coca leaves and kola nuts (a source of caffeine). The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret; however, a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published. The secrecy around the formula has been used by Coca-Cola in its marketing as only a handful of anonymous employees know the formula. The drink has inspired imitators and created a whole classification of soft drink: colas.\nThe Coca-Cola Company produces concentrate, which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world. The bottlers, who hold exclusive territory contracts with the company, produce the finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate, in combination with filtered water and sweeteners. A typical 12-US-fluid-ounce (350 ml) can contains 38 grams (1.3 oz) of sugar (usually in the form of high-fructose corn syrup in North America). The bottlers then sell, distribute, and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores, restaurants, and vending machines throughout the world. The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for soda fountains of major restaurants and foodservice distributors.\nThe Coca-Cola Company has on occasion introduced other cola drinks under the Coke name. The most common of these is Diet Coke, along with others including Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola, Diet Coke Caffeine-Free, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Coca-Cola Cherry, Coca-Cola Vanilla, and special versions with lemon, lime, and coffee. Coca-Cola was called Coca-Cola Classic from July 1985 to 2009, to distinguish it from \"New Coke\".",

It was available in 20-ounce, 2-liter, and 12-pack can forms.\nThe release of this product coincided with the phasing out of Vanilla Coke and its diet counterpart in North America and the renaming of Cherry Coke as Coca-Cola Cherry.\nThroughout the first 6 months of the product's sale, the percentage of drinks bought from Coca-Cola and its variants that was Black Cherry Vanilla Coke was 4%, compared to 9% for Coca-Cola with Lime and 3% for Diet Black Cherry Vanilla Coke compared to 7% for Diet Coke with Lime, 13% for the Caffeine free Colas, 13.5% for Coke Cherry and Diet Coke Cherry, and 26% for Diet Coke.\nWith low sales figures, and the return of Vanilla Coke (now Coca-Cola Vanilla) in the summer of 2007 in the United States, Black Cherry Vanilla Coke was discontinued.Coca-Cola Freestyle fountains have a variation in the form of Coca-Cola Cherry Vanilla, which would later on be released in cans/bottles in February 2020.",

The mid-calorie drink was introduced first in France and subsequently in other markets, including Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Lithuania.\nCoca-Cola Blak launched in the United States on April 3, and in Canada on August 29, 2006 in Toronto, Ontario, at Dundas Square.  In August 2007, trade magazine Beverage Digest noted that Coca-Cola would discontinue the drink within the United States.The French and Canadian versions of Coca-Cola Blak were sweetened with sugar. The U.S. version of Coca-Cola Blak replaced sugar with high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, and acesulfame potassium. Consumer Reports taste-testers found the French version to be less sweet and to contain more coffee flavor.The American and Canadian versions had a plastic resealable cap on a glass bottle that resembled the classic Coke bottle, where the French/Czech version was a bottle shape formed in aluminum.In 2010, Coca-Cola FEMSA, the largest Coca-Cola bottler in Latin America, released coffee dispenser machines in Mexico under the brand name Blak.In 2019, it was reported that Coca-Cola have started to plan an introduction of coffee-related products across 25 markets by the end of the year. The coffee has been planned to combine Coca-Cola with coffee, which will contain less caffeine than a regular cup of coffee but more than a regular can of Coke. This rollout, which started in European markets, culminated in the release of Coca-Cola with Coffee in the US on January 25, 2021.",

        "summary": "Coca-Cola C2 (also referred to as Coke C2, C2 Cola, or simply C2) was a cola-flavored beverage introduced by The Coca-Cola Company first in Japan, then later on June 7, 2004 in the United States (and shortly thereafter, Canada), in response to the low-carbohydrate diet trend. This Coke product was marketed as having half the carbohydrates, sugars and calories compared to standard Coca-Cola. It contained aspartame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose in addition to the high fructose corn syrup typically found in cola beverages distributed in America.Aside from the high fructose corn syrup, one 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola C2 contains 19 mg of aspartame, 4 mg of sucralose and 19 mg of acesulfame potassium. The packaging design differs from other Coke products in that the logos are printed in black. For marketing on radio and television, and movie theaters the Queen song \"I Want to Break Free\" was used. When it was first introduced, though, The Rolling Stones song \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" was used.  Various NASCAR Cup Series drivers ran paint schemes in the 2004 Pepsi 400 race to promote the new drink.\nAmerican sales did not live up to early expectations mainly due to customer disinterest in a mid-calorie soda, and partly due to the success of Coca-Cola Zero, a zero-calorie version of Coca-Cola; however, Coca-Cola said the brand would remain in its lineup, even while Pepsi discontinued its equivalent product, Pepsi Edge, in late 2005, just one year after its introduction. Many store shelves completely replaced the product with Coca-Cola Zero due to display, shelving and storage limitations, and with the introduction of Coca-Cola Cherry Zero, the product disappeared from all store shelves where it had previously remained, and in 2013, it was replaced by Coca-Cola Life, which was marketed for using Stevia as opposed to artificial sweeteners.",

Inca Kola is available in parts of South America, North America and Europe, and while it has not enjoyed major success outside Peru, it can be found in Latin American specialty shops worldwide.

It is popular in the New York City region and South Florida, but it can also be found in Jewish delicatessens and upscale supermarkets around the United States and in English-speaking neighborhoods in Israel. Slogans for the products have included \"Imported From the Old Neighborhood\" and \"Taste of the Town\".Dr. Brown's was created in 1869 and was commonly sold in New York delicatessens and by soda salesmen who sold the product from door to door in Jewish neighborhoods. According to former marketing director, Harry Gold, a New York doctor used celery seeds and sugar to invent the soda and celery tonic now known as Cel-Ray, which was advertised as a \"pure beverage for the nerves\". However, some have speculated that there may never have been a Dr. Brown and that the name may have been only a marketing invention.In the early 1930s, before Coca-Cola received kosher certification, many Jews drank Cel-Ray soda as well as the other soda flavors that had been created by Dr. Brown's. The labels were designed in the 1970s by Herb Lubalin and features a New York vignette taken from old prints, to emphasize the brand's origins in 1800s New York.\nDr. Brown's varieties include The Original Cream Soda (regular and diet), Black Cherry soda (regular and diet), Ginger Ale, Root Beer (regular and diet), and Cel-Ray (celery-flavored soda). Former flavors include Cola, Orange, Grape, Tune-Up (Lemon) and Club Soda.\nDr. Brown's soda is typically sold in 12-ounce cans and two-liter bottles.",

        "summary": "Dr Pepper is a carbonated soft drink. It was created in the 1880s by pharmacist Charles Alderton in Waco, Texas, and first served around 1885. Dr Pepper was first nationally marketed in the United States in 1904. It is now also sold in Europe, Asia, North and South America. In Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, Dr Pepper is sold as an imported good. Variants include Diet Dr Pepper and, beginning in the 2000s, a line of additional flavors. \nAlthough Dr Pepper has similarities to cola, the American Food and Drug Administration has ruled that Dr Pepper is not a cola, nor a root beer, nor a fruit-flavored soft drink.  Rather, Dr Pepper is said to be in a category of its own kind, called \"pepper soda\", named for the brand.  Other soft drinks in this category, such as Dublin Original and Mr Pibb, have a similar flavor profile.Dr Pepper is the fourth highest-selling carbonated soft drink in the United States, and the sixth highest-selling in the United Kingdom.",

Fanta soon dominated the German market with three million cases sold in 1943. The current formulation of Fanta, with orange flavour, was developed in Italy in 1955.",

Citra had a very similar flavor to Fresca, especially the version of Fresca sold in Latin America, which is sweetened with sucrose (table sugar) rather than aspartame as in the American version of Fresca. It also had a flavor similar to Squirt, except that Squirt contains a trace of orange or tangerine flavoring.  Citra also had a very similar flavor to that of Canfield's 50/50.\nIn the U.S., Citra was rebranded as Fanta Citrus as of 15 March 2004. Citra should not be confused with Coca-Cola Citra, a variety of Coca-Cola with citrus flavoring.\nThe original marketing campaign had the theme \"Curiously crisp Citra\". The drink was always referred to as \"citrus flavored\" and never as grapefruit flavored, even though most of the taste was grapefruit and sugar.\nIt was made in the Citrus Blend and Lemon flavors. Fanta Citrus is now discontinued, but was only in certain areas of the U.S.\nA flavor of Fanta, Fanta Grapefruit, is said to taste similar to Citra.",

It was originally made for the Gators at the University of Florida to replenish the carbohydrates that the school's student-athletes burned and the combination of water and electrolytes that they lost in sweat during vigorous sports activities.\nOriginally produced and marketed by Stokely-Van Camp, the Gatorade brand was purchased by the Quaker Oats Company in 1983, which, in turn, was bought by PepsiCo in 2000. As of 2010, Gatorade is PepsiCo's fourth-largest brand, on the basis of worldwide annual retail sales. It competes with Coca-Cola's Powerade and Vitaminwater brands worldwide, and with Lucozade in the United Kingdom. Within the United States, Gatorade accounts for approximately 67.7% of market share in the sports drink category.",

        "summary": "Irn-Bru ( \"iron brew\", Scots: [\u02cc\u0259ir\u0259n\u02c8bru\u02d0]) is a Scottish carbonated soft drink, often described as \"Scotland's other national drink\" (after whisky). Introduced in 1901, the drink is produced in Westfield, Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, by A.G. Barr of Glasgow. As well as being sold throughout the United Kingdom, Irn-Bru is available throughout the world and can usually be bought where there is a significant community of people from Scotland. The brand also has its own tartan. It has been the top-selling soft drink in Scotland for over a century, competing directly with global brands such as Coca-Cola.Originally sold as Iron Brew, the drinks makers A.G Barr were forced to change the name of the drink in 1946 following a change in the law that stipulated that the marketing of products required to be \"literally true\". As the drink did not contain much iron, nor was it brewed, led the company to changing the name to the presently used Irn-Bru. Irn-Bru has long been the most popularly consumed soft drink in Scotland, consistently beating rivals such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Fanta, and reportedly sells 20 cans every second throughout Scotland. Irn-Bru is sold in a number of international food and drink markets, including in countries such as the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, Malta, certain countries of the African continent, the Middle East, and North America.In 2014, Irn-Bru was one of a number of imported products, including Marmite, banned in Canada as a result of its additives in its ingredients, however a statement released by the Government of Canada in October 2020 stipulated that \"Irn-Bru and Marmite are not banned for sale in Canada. These products have been available on Canadian store shelves for more than a decade and will continue to be sold in stores across Canada. ...Imported products, including Irn Bru and Marmite, that meet Canadian requirements under Canada's Food and Drug Regulations are and will continue to be available for sale in Canada.\"",

Chauhan decided to come up with his own formula, which he launched under the Limca brand in 1977.In 1992, when the Indian government allowed Coca-Cola to return for operations, at the same time as it admitted Pepsi for the first time, Coca-Cola bought local soft-drink (soda) brands, from Parle Bisleri owner Ramesh Chauhan including Limca, Thums Up (a cola-like drink), Maaza (a mango-juice based drink), Citra (a clear lemon-lime drink), and Gold Spot (orange flavour).Prior to 1988, the original formula of Limca contained brominated vegetable oil (BVO). After worldwide reports of ill effects of BVO, its use in soft drinks was banned in India.  As a result of this ban, the formula for Limca was changed.",

        "summary": "Lucozade is a British brand of soft drinks and energy drinks manufactured and marketed by the Japanese company Suntory. Created as \"Glucozade\" in the UK in 1927 by a Newcastle pharmacist, William Walker Hunter (trading as W. Owen & Son), it was acquired by the British pharmaceutical company Beecham's in 1938 and sold as Lucozade, an energy drink for the sick. Its advertising slogan was \"Lucozade aids recovery\". It was sold mostly in pharmacies up until the 1980s before it was more readily available as a sports drink in shops across the UK.\nA glucose and water solution, the product was sold until 1983 as a carbonated, slightly orange-flavoured drink in a glass bottle wrapped in cellophane. Pharmacists sold it, children were given it when ill, and hospital visitors would regularly arrive with a bottle. It was rebranded in 1978 as a \"pick me up\", and as a sports drink in 1983, to associate it with health rather than sickness. The company switched to a plastic bottle and introduced a range of flavours. As of 2016, a 500 ml bottle contained 62 g (15.5 cubes) of sugar, more than Coca-Cola. In 2017, to avoid sugar tax, the drink was reformulated to contain 22.5 g of sugar per 500 ml of liquid, as well as the artificial sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame K. In 2023, it was reformulated again. It still contains the same amount of sugar, but aspartame was swapped out for sucralose.The UK\u2019s No. 1 energy drink, it has been exported to Asia and Australasia. In 1989, the Beecham Group merged to form SmithKline Beecham, which further merged in 2000 to form GlaxoSmithKline. In September 2013, GlaxoSmithKline sold Lucozade and another soft drink, Ribena, to the Japanese drinks conglomerate Suntory for \u00a31.35 billion.",

The original formula was invented in 1940 by Tennessee beverage bottlers Barney and Ally Hartman. A revised formula was created by Bill Bridgforth in 1958. The rights to this formula were obtained by the Tip Corporation of Marion, Virginia. William H. \"Bill\" Jones of the Tip Corporation further refined the formula, launching that version of Mountain Dew in 1961. In August 1964, the Mountain Dew brand and production rights were acquired from Tip by the Pepsi-Cola company, and the distribution expanded across the United States and Canada.Between the 1940s and 1980s there was only one variety of Mountain Dew, which was citrus-flavored and caffeinated in most markets. Diet Mountain Dew was introduced in 1988, followed by Mountain Dew Red, which was introduced and discontinued in 1988. In 2001, a cherry-flavored variant called Code Red debuted. Expansions of the product line have continued to this day, including specialty offerings, limited time productions, region-specific and retailer-specific flavors of Mountain Dew.\nProduction was extended to the United Kingdom in 1996, but was phased out in 1998. A similarly named but different-tasting product, with a recipe more similar to the original American product has been sold in the U.K. under the name \"Mountain Dew Energy\" since 2010 and in Ireland since the spring of 2011. As of 2017, Mountain Dew represented a 6.6% share of the carbonated soft drinks market in the U.S. Its competition includes the Coca-Cola Company's Mello Yello and Surge, and Keurig Dr Pepper's Sun Drop; Mountain Dew accounted for 80% of citrus soft drinks sold within the U.S. in 2010.",

        "summary": "New Coke was the unofficial name of a reformulation of the soft drink Coca-Cola, introduced by The Coca-Cola Company in April, 1985. It was renamed Coke II in 1990, and discontinued in July 2002.\nBy 1985, Coca-Cola had been losing market share to diet soft drinks and non-cola beverages for several years. Blind taste tests suggested that consumers preferred the sweeter taste of the competing product Pepsi-Cola, and so the Coca-Cola recipe was reformulated. The American public reacted negatively, and New Coke was considered a major failure.\nThe company reintroduced the original formula within three months, rebranded \"Coca-Cola Classic\", resulting in a significant sales boost. This led to speculation that the New Coke formula had been a ploy to stimulate sales of the original Coca-Cola, which the company has vehemently denied. The story of New Coke remains influential as a cautionary tale against tampering with an established successful brand.",

When it was introduced, Qoo completely replaced Hi-C in Japan, Qoo is now available throughout much of Asia in a variety of flavors including grape and orange. As soon as Qoo was introduced, the white grape flavor was available at drink fountains in Japan, including at McDonald's. In Germany, the product line was sold from January 2003 until November 2005.\nThe name comes from the mascot's reaction to tasting the drink. The mascot was designed by Momoko Maruyama, who created Deko Boko Friends. The jingle, for the original Japanese commercial, is sung by Londell \"Taz\" Hicks, an American now living in Japan who is best known for the AKB48 overture.\nQoo is transliterated in Chinese as \u9177\u5152 (k\u00f9\u00e9r). It evokes images of \"cool kid\" since \u9177 (k\u00f9) is a transliteration of the English word cool and \u5152 (\u00e9r) means 'child' or 'son'.",

It was originally launched in Norway as Urge in 1996, and was so popular that it was released in the United States as Surge in 1997. Lagging sales caused production to be ended in 2003 for most markets.However, popular fan bases such as Facebook's \"SURGE Movement\" led Coca-Cola to re-release the soft drink on September 15, 2014, for the US market via Amazon Prime in 12-packs of 16-US-fluid-ounce (470 mL) cans. Following a test-market for the beverage in the Southeastern United States in early 2015, Surge was re-released primarily in convenience stores in the Eastern United States and some Mountain states in September 2015. Surge was re-released internationally in September 2018 in Burger King restaurants in the Coca-Cola Freestyle machines.",

        "summary": "Tab (stylized as TaB) was a diet cola soft drink produced and distributed by The Coca-Cola Company, introduced in 1963 and discontinued in 2020. The company's first diet drink, Tab was popular among some people throughout the 1960s and 1970s as an alternative to Coca-Cola. Several variations were made, including a number of fruit-flavored, root beer, and ginger ale versions. Caffeine-free and clear variations were released in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nFollowing studies in the early 1970s that linked saccharin, Tab's main sweetener, with bladder cancer in rats, the United States Congress mandated warning labels on products containing the sweetener. The label requirement was later repealed when no plausibility was found for saccharin causing cancer in humans.Tab's popularity declined after the Coca-Cola company's introduction of Diet Coke in 1982, though it remained the best-selling diet soda of that year. Coca-Cola continued to produce Tab in the United States, though in considerably smaller quantities than its more popular mainstay beverages, such as Coca-Cola and Diet Coke. According to the company, three million cases of Tab were made in 2011, and the beverage retained a cult following. In 2006, a Tab-branded energy drink was released, though it used a different formula from the standard cola. Coca-Cola discontinued Tab at the end of 2020.",

Venom Energy was released in 2002 in a more typical beverage container and was relaunched in the new aluminum bottle and with a new taste in early 2008.Originally known as Elements Energy, but later rebranded after sales began to wane.\nSome of the original Elements flavors did survive the rebranding: \nBlack Mamba (Venom), Mango (Infusion), Citrus (Voltage), Strawberry Apple (Atomic), Black Cherry Kiwi (Subzero).\nIn 2008, Venom Energy entered into a partnership with the Arena Football League to promote the product during the 2008 playoffs on ESPN and ABC. In addition, Terrell Owens is now a spokesman for the brand. The company also sponsors the Andretti Autosport IndyCar Series team with driver Marco Andretti, Pavel Datsyuk of the Detroit Red Wings, Max Talbot of the Pittsburgh Penguins and Milan Lucic of the Boston Bruins, all from the NHL as well as Jordan Farmar of the New Jersey Nets (NBA) and Lance Berkman of the St. Louis Cardinals (MLB).",

They may or may not be carbonated and may also contain sugar, other sweeteners, or herbal extracts, among numerous possible ingredients. \nThey are a subset of the larger group of energy products, which includes bars and gels, and distinct from sports drinks, which are advertised to enhance sports performance. There are many brands and varieties in this drink category.Energy drinks have the effects of caffeine and sugar, but there is little or no evidence that the wide variety of other ingredients have any effect. Most effects of energy drinks on cognitive performance, such as increased attention and reaction speed, are primarily due to the presence of caffeine. Other studies ascribe those performance improvements to the effects of the combined ingredients.Advertising for energy drinks usually features increased muscle strength and endurance, but there is no scientific consensus to support these claims. Energy drinks have been associated with many health risks, such as an increased rate of injury when usage is combined with alcohol, and excessive or repeated consumption can lead to cardiac and psychiatric conditions. Populations at risk for complications from energy drink consumption include youth, caffeine-na\u00efve or caffeine-sensitive, pregnant, competitive athletes and people with underlying cardiovascular disease.",

The specific customs vary from region to region. Fr\u00fchschoppen is often a kind of brunch, but does not necessarily involve food. Fr\u00fchschoppen is also often held at fun fairs, the most famous being Oktoberfest or Cannstatter Volksfest.\nIn Lower Bavaria and most of Upper Bavaria, Fr\u00fchschoppen is understood to be a specific kind of brunch consisting of Weisswurst, sweet mustard, pretzels, and Weissbier (an unfiltered wheat beer). The Bavarian Fr\u00fchschoppen began in rural areas and has originally taken place on Sundays in a tavern at the regulars' table (Stammtisch). During Fr\u00fchschoppen, folk may discuss everyday life and politics. In the corner of the tavern or festival tent (Festzelt) there is typically a band playing Volksmusik. (Nowadays some places have pop, rock, and jazz bands.)\nIn many other regions of Germany, Fr\u00fchschoppen is understood more generally to be a gathering in a pub on Sunday morning, traditionally held after church service. This usually includes the consumption of alcoholic beverages, but not necessarily that of a meal. With the decline of church attendance in Germany this tradition has become somewhat less common, but is still held up in many places, especially in rural areas.",

Suhur corresponds to iftar- the evening meal during Ramadan, replacing the traditional three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), although in some places dinner is also consumed after iftar later during the night.\nBeing the last meal eaten by Muslims before fasting from dawn to sunset during the month of Ramadan, suhur is regarded by Islamic traditions as a benefit of the blessings in that it allows the person fasting to avoid the crankiness or the weakness caused by the fast. According to a hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari, Anas ibn Malik narrated, \"The Prophet said, 'take suhur as there is a blessing in it.'\"",

        "summary": "Aerated chocolate, also known as air chocolate, is a type of chocolate which has been turned into a foam via the addition of gas bubbles. The process for manufacturing it was invented by Rowntree's in 1935. During manufacturing the fluid chocolate mass is foamed with a propellant, and then cooled in a low pressure environment.  As the bubbles of gas expand they cool and help set the chocolate. This helps to maintain an even bubble distribution within the chocolate. Due to the isolating effect of the bubbles, air chocolate melts differently from compact bar chocolate\u2014the feeling of the chocolate melting is fragile-short at first, then as the chocolate is chewed it melts rapidly due to its bigger surface area.Nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide are often used as propellants for air chocolate. Air itself is not used as a propellant because it contains oxygen which speeds up rancidification of the chocolate. A survey funded by Nestl\u00e9, conducted at the University of Reading, revealed that chocolate foamed with nitrogen\u2014and especially with nitrous oxide\u2014has the most intense taste. The researchers found that this was due to the larger bubbles which these gases produce. Further research by Nestl\u00e9 has concluded that \"[t]he existing technology to control bubble size and distribution is difficult,\" which has led to experiments involving the creation of foams under zero-gravity conditions.In 2013, Chinese scientists announced results from a study using phospholipids derived from soybeans to aerate cocoa butter.",

The Indianapolis plant had a large, white and black spotted cow on a white pole located at the south end of the main parking lot. This was to inform the public that their product was milk-based. After Moxie, Choc-Ola was owned by various companies, the last of which was Dr Pepper Snapple Group in 2009, which retired the product.In early 2010, Dan Iaria, the owner of the Rock-Cola '50s Caf\u00e9 in Indianapolis secured the trademark and began selling Choc-Ola again. On March 21, 2011, it was announced that an agreement was made with Prairie Farms to produce and distribute Choc-Ola through South Bend, Indiana-based Martin's Super Markets, a regional 21-store chain. Prairie Farms announced later that year that they planned to eventually distribute Choc-Ola in 17 states in individual-sized bottles and half-gallon jugs, primarily at grocery stores and convenience stores.",

        "summary": "A chocoholic is a person who craves or compulsively consumes chocolate. The word \"chocoholic\" was first used in 1968, according to Merriam-Webster. It is a portmanteau of \"chocolate\" and \"alcoholic\". The term is used loosely or humorously to describe a person who is inordinately fond of chocolate; however, there is medical evidence to support the existence of actual addiction to chocolate.  Psychoactive constituents of chocolate that trigger a \u2018feel-good\u2019 reaction for the consumer include tryptophan and phenylethylamine, which may contribute to cravings and addiction-like responses, particularly in people with specific genetic alleles. The quantity of sugars used in chocolate confections also impacts the psychoactive effects of chocolate.Although the concept of a chocolate addiction is still controversial in the medical literature, chocolate (especially dark chocolate) is considered to have effects on mood, and chocolate confectioneries almost always top the list of foods people say they crave. The craving can be so strong in some cases that chocoholics may experience withdrawal symptoms if the craving is not fulfilled.",

Chocolate chip cookies are claimed to have originated in the United States in 1938, when Ruth Graves Wakefield chopped up a Nestl\u00e9 semi-sweet chocolate bar and added the chopped chocolate to a cookie recipe; however, historical recipes for grated or chopped chocolate cookies exist prior to 1938 by various other authors.Generally, the recipe starts with a dough composed of flour, butter, both brown and white sugar, semi-sweet chocolate chips, eggs, and vanilla. Variations on the recipe may add other types of chocolate, as well as additional ingredients such as nuts or oatmeal. There are also vegan versions with the necessary ingredient substitutions, such as vegan chocolate chips, vegan margarine, and egg substitutes. A chocolate chocolate chip cookie uses a dough flavored with chocolate or cocoa powder, before chocolate chips are mixed in. These variations of the recipe are also referred to as \u2018double\u2019 or \u2018triple\u2019 chocolate chip cookies, depending on the combination of dough and chocolate types.",

The company manufactures other chocolate products, but Ibarra table chocolate is its best-known product, with presence throughout Mexico as well as international markets, mainly in the Americas, but also in parts of Europe.\nIbarra tablets are packaged in a distinctive red-and-yellow hexagon-shaped cardboard box. Each circular tablet of table chocolate is about 1/2\" thick and 31\u20444\" in diameter, and is molded into 8 wedges. The letters of the name \"IBARRA\" are also molded into the chocolate. The ingredients are cocoa paste, sugar, cinnamon, and soy lecithin. A premium grade version does not contain vegetable fat, which is often used in chocolate based foods as a less expensive substitute, with the only fat being the cocoa butter in the cocoa liquor.Unlike chocolate bars, and because of its undissolved granulated sugar, and its rough and gritty texture, tablet chocolate is not meant to be eaten like a chocolate bar, although Ibarra tablets can be eaten.  However, Ibarra is used primarily to make hot cocoa in traditional Mexican form. The labeling on Ibarra's packaging suggests that the best way to prepare Ibarra is to use approximately two wedges for each cup of milk or water.  Heat the milk until it is near boiling, then blend the milk and chocolate in a blender until the chocolate is completely dissolved, and serve hot. Ibarra can also be prepared on the stove by dissolving the wedges in hot milk, then whisking the cocoa with a molinillo or wire whisk. In Mexico, in the traditional Aztec and Mayan form, Cayenne pepper is added to make it a spicy chocolate drink.\nIt is also used in some mole sauces, in particular, mole poblano.",

Sabra is 30% alcohol by volume.The Sabra bottle design is based on a 2,000-year-old Phoenician wine flask found in a Tel Aviv museum.Sabra was developed and introduced in 1963 by Edgar Bronfman, Sr., the head of Seagram, to be an identifiably Israeli liqueur. Its name is a term used affectionately to describe a native-born Israeli Jew, a term derived from the Hebrew name of a prickly pear cactus that grows in Israel. The original liqueur was made from this cactus fruit, but did not succeed and was quickly changed to the successful chocolate-orange product.There are now two Sabra liqueurs, all produced by Binyamina Winery, and all are kosher and kosher for Passover. The newer products are Sabra Coffee liqueur, launched in 1985, and Grand Sabra, an orange-flavored brandy, launched in 2006.\n\nThe product is still produced at Binyamina wine's and is available under this name by other manufacturers.",

In 1916, it was renamed Pomagne.\nIt was originally produced by the m\u00e9thode champenoise using only the juice from the first pressing.\nBulmers marketed Pomagne as \"champagne cider\" until Bollinger took it to court over the use of the term \"champagne\" in 1974. Bulmers won the case, but stopped using the m\u00e9thode champenoise in 1975 and changed to making Pomagne by bulk fermentation in a 6,000-gallon tank.\nThe drink was referenced in the BBC sitcom The Royle Family, along with the Snowball.\nPomagne was discontinued at some point prior to 2013, at which time Bulmers stated it was not planning to reintroduce the drink.",

        "summary": "Red Rock Cider was an alcoholic beverage produced by Taunton Cider Company and sold in the UK during the late 1980s and early 1990s. This brewery grew significantly after WWII due to an increase in inventory orders from other brewing industries who were merging during the 50s and 60s. Although it met its decline shortly after the UK Monopolies Commission required large breweries to break apart their monopolies, \"The Taunton Cider Company\" was successfully re-registered by cider enthusiasts in 2015, and began production in 2016.  Its cider is produced in Somerset county which has a rich history of cider production, going back to the late 17th to 19th centuries where cider was considered a currency and farmers would sometimes be paid their daily wage with cider.  Unusually, it is remembered most fondly for its advertisements, which had the strapline \"It's not red, and there's no rocks in it\". The original ending, \"It doesn't taste like cider\" was dropped.In 1990, a series of TV adverts, directed by John Lloyd, were produced in the style of Police Squad! (but titled as Fraud Squad!) and starred Leslie Nielsen in a role clearly similar to that of Detective Frank Drebin.  (In one advert, an extremely brief close-up of Nielsen's Fraud Squad badge (which actually reads FRIED SQUID) identifies him as \"Drebin, Lt. F.\") The titles of each advert followed the Police Squad! joke style of having a different title in the voice-over than what appeared captioned on screen. Hank Marvin made a cameo appearance in one advert (after Nielsen's character shouts \"Hey you over there in the shadows!\")\n\n\n== References ==",

Its marketing slogan is \"Enuf is Enough!\"\nDr. Enuf's origins date back to 1949, when a Chicago businessman named William Mark Swartz was urged by coworkers to formulate a soft drink fortified with vitamins as an alternative to sugar sodas full of empty calories. He developed an \"energy booster\" drink containing B vitamins, caffeine and cane sugar. After placing a notice in a trade magazine seeking a bottler, he formed a partnership with Charles Gordon of Tri-City Beverage to produce and distribute the soda.",

The cans featured bright yellow packaging for regular Rondo and green packaging for Diet Rondo. It was introduced in 1978 by Cadbury-Schweppes.\nSchweppes sells a similar drink in Australia under the name Solo.The drink and its name were parodied in the 2006 film Idiocracy as \"Brawndo: The Thirst Mutilator\".\nIn 2023 Rondo returned for sale in the U.S. market.

        "summary": "Sisi (stylized as SiSi; originally si si) is the brand name of a wide range of fruit-flavoured beverages produced by  Dutch beverage manufacturing company Vrumona under a joint venture with Heineken International since 1951. The manufacturing plant is located at Bunnik, The Netherlands.\nIn 1936, George Becht launched a grapefruit-flavoured drink called Ja-Ja. One year later, an apple-flavoured drink was launched under the si si name. After George Becht died in 1949, his son Cornelius took over and adopted the \"si si\" name to the similar products of the company Vrumona.\nBetween 1951 and 1969 there were a number of similarly named drinks, including Cas-Si (blackcurrant), Ceri-Se (cherry) and Grapy (grapefruit). In 1969, the name Si si was changed to one word, Sisi. These were later brought under the SiSi name: Cas-Si became SiSi cassis (blackcurrant), Ceri-Se became SiSi Cerise (cherry) and Grapy became Sisi grapefruit. In 1987, these flavours were purchased by another company and relaunched under the name Royal Club.\nIn 1957, cabaret singer Wim Sonneveld on Radio Luxembourg sung the company's first jingle \"ome Daan the Si-Si-liaan\". In 1972, and 1973, two well known Dutch actors, John Kraaijkamp sr. and Rijk de Gooijer, acted in some television commercials for the brand. Since the early 1990s, the company has used the slogan \"Take it easy, take a SiSi\". In recent years, Sisi has touted itself as having half as much sugar as similar products produced by its competitors.",

When Denis Irwin was playing for Manchester United, his mother would send him Tanora and Tayto crisps from Cork. In the play Disco Pigs, Pig orders \"Two Battur burgurs! Two Sauce! Two Chips! Two Peas! Two Tanora!\".In April 2011, Tanora was reformulated with a new taste including carrot and blackcurrant flavourings, and new packaging with the subtitle \"A Cork legend\" was introduced. The new flavour proved unpopular, and a Facebook vote along with taste-tests in Cork retail stores was scheduled to take place during July 2011. The new flavour was later taken off the market and replaced with the old, it kept the same bottle as the new flavour but had \"original formula\" on the side so it could be distinguished from the new flavour.\nIn January 2018, ahead of the Irish government's planned introduction of a \"sugar tax\" later that year, Tanora was slightly reformulated again, to replace some of its sugar with artificial sweeteners.",

Its popularity continued to expand as Grupo Yoli was granted its first Coca-Cola bottling franchise in 1938, located in Acapulco. It has been described as a less watery version of Sprite.The soda became available in the Toluca and Cuernavaca markets in December 2008. The brand was previously under the care by Grupo Yoli, a Coca-Cola bottling company in Guerrero. In 2008, Yoli was acquired by FEMSA in January 2013. The merger in turn allowed the Grupo Yoli bottling plants to bottle Coca-Cola Company brand sodas, such as Coca-Cola and Fanta. This purchase was successfully completed in May 2013, and allowed for Coca-Cola FEMSA to produce the Yoli soda, which was formerly the trademark beverage of Grupo Yoli. After the purchase, FEMSA was able to expand the beverage's popularity into neighboring areas.Yoli is currently produced by 2 bottling facilities operated by Grupo Yoli.\n\n\n== References ==",

Named after the backdraft which occurs in some fire situations, this drink produces a similar condition on purpose using flammable alcoholic drinks and an enclosing container, such as an upside down pint glass. Below is a typical procedure for producing one variation of the backdraft drink. The combination of warm alcohol, followed by inhaling vaporized alcohol, and then finishing with a highly spiced warm alcohol, makes the drinking of this drink difficult, and while it tends not to have an immediate effect (since it is drunk quickly), the warmth of the alcohol and the vapor, make the concentration and absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream quicker than other drinks, and produces a more profound impact.\nThe procedure listed below is a typical illustration of how the drink is presented, and the steps used to produce the backdraft effect. The alcohols listed can be substituted with others, as there are various recipes. However, the steps of this procedure are required to be taken in this order to produce what is known as a classic backdraft drink.",

It is garnished with a pineapple wedge, maraschino cherry and cocktail umbrella and served in a hurricane glass with pebble ice, or in a Collins glass. A frozen Blue Hawaiian can be made by putting all the ingredients in a blender with some crushed ice and pulsing them to a creamy consistency.The use of light rum allows the blue color from the cura\u00e7ao to come through. Adding more pineapple juice results in a greenish blue color. Champagne or prosecco can be added to make a sparkling Blue Hawaiian.Difford's Guide notes, \"Probably created by Don the Beachcomber in Los Angeles, USA, this is a riff on the Blue Hawaii.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

That changed in 1953, when the first Coca-Cola factory opened in Spain. The combination was given various names, until its mass usage at a festival in Algorta led to it being christened the kalimotxo, a playful combination of the two creators' nicknames, Kalimero and Motxongo.It has since become a classic of the Basque Country region, in large part due to its simple mixture, accessibility of ingredients, and cheap cost.The same mixture is known as katemba in South Africa, c\u00e1tembe in Mozambique, bambus (bamboo) in Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia and other Balkan countries, jote (black vulture) in Chile, ColaRot in Austria and jesus juice in Argentina.\n\n\n== References ==",

A cocktail party organized for purposes of social or business networking is called a mixer.\nSome events, such as wedding receptions, are preceded by a cocktail hour. During the cocktail hour, guests socialize while drinking and eating appetizers. Organizers of these events use the cocktail hour to occupy guests between related events and to reduce the number of guests who arrive late.\nAlthough it has been said that the inventor of the cocktail party was Alec Waugh of London, an article in the St. Paul Pioneer Press in May 1917 credited its invention to Mrs. Julius S. Walsh Jr. of St. Louis, Missouri. Mrs. Walsh invited 50 guests to her house on a Sunday at high noon for a one-hour affair. \"The party scored an instant hit,\" the newspaper declared, stating that within weeks cocktail parties had become \"a St. Louis institution\".Alec Waugh noted that the first cocktail party in England was hosted in 1924 by war artist Christopher Nevinson.German author Walter Leonhardt advised readers to observe \"three fundamental rules\" of cocktail parties, in a 1962 book on culture and customs of England:\n\nIt should not last long, an hour and a half maximum, the time one can stand up, even if there are chairs for weaker constitutions.\nGuests should enter and leave freely, avoiding elaborate greetings on arrival and departure.\nConversation must avoid passionate subjects (personal, political or religious topics) to keep a harmonious and cheerful ambiance.",

In Australia and New Zealand \"premix\" and ready to drink (RTD) are both commonly used terms. \"Malternative\" is an exclusively American term for the malt-based alcopops.  \"Spirit cooler\" is used in South Africa for distilled alcohol versions.\nHard seltzer is a related category of alcoholic drinks based on flavored seltzer water. Hard soda, meanwhile, is specifically related to soft drinks. Hard lemonade, which could be considered an alcopop, has been around for some time. Hard cider, on the other hand, is a fermented beverage similar to wine or beer.",

        "summary": "A flip is a class of mixed drinks.  According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term was first used in 1695 to describe a mixture of beer, rum, and sugar, heated with a red-hot iron (\"Thus we live at sea; eat biscuit, and drink flip\").  The iron caused the drink to froth, and this frothing (or \"flipping\") engendered the name.  Over time, eggs were added and the proportion of sugar increased, the beer was eliminated, and the drink ceased to be served hot.The first bar guide to feature a flip was Jerry Thomas's 1862 How to Mix Drinks; or, The Bon-Vivant's Companion.  In this work, Thomas declares that, \"The essential in flips of all sorts is to produce the smoothness by repeated pouring back and forward between two vessels and beating up the eggs well in the first instance the sweetening and spices according to taste.\"With time, the distinction between egg nog (a spirit, egg, cream, sugar, and spice) and a flip (a spirit, egg, sugar, spice, but no cream) was gradually codified in U.S. bar guides.  In recent decades, bar guides have begun to indicate the presence of cream in a flip as optional.",

It is especially popular in the fall and winter and is traditionally associated with the holiday season. In the United States, the drink has a lengthy history that dates back to colonial days. During that time many families had their own individual recipes, and early Americans believed rum to be nutritious and a strengthener of the body.In How to Mix Drinks: Or, The Bon-vivant's Companion, mid-19th-century bartender Jerry Thomas provides two recipes (No. 207 and 208, p. 80) for hot rum drinks. The first is called Hot Spiced Rum. The recipe calls for sugar, Jamaica rum, cloves, allspice, butter, and hot water. The second is simply called Hot Rum, and the recipe is the same as for Hot Spiced Rum but omits the spices. In their stead a bit of nutmeg is grated over the top of the drink.",

Cooler is a vintage tiki cocktail invented by Donn Beach that calls for a mixture of several rums (Puerto Rican dark rum, Jamaican rum, Demerara 151 proof rum), two syrups (fassionola, falernum), fruit juices (orange, lime), and honey, mixed with club soda and dashes of Pernod, bitters, and grenadine. Another version purported to be from 1937 is slightly different and calls for varying rum proportions and ginger syrup in place of the fassionola and Pernod.",

Start with one part coffee liqueur then Midori and finish with Baileys. The Baileys is poured off the back of a bar spoon so it \"floats\" on top of the midori in a shot glass. Note that Baileys does not have to be used; any type of Irish Cream will do.\nThere are special machines that can prepare a quick fuck (or other multi-layered cocktails) in only a few seconds, but an experienced bartender usually relies on the traditional, handmade preparation. Cocktails with horizontal layering, like the quick fuck, are called \"pousse caf\u00e9\". This method of preparation is called \"building\", as opposed to blending or shaking; thus, quick fucks are \"built\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "summary": "Salmiakki Koskenkorva, (also Salmiakkikossu for short, or Salmari more colloquially) is a pre-mixed liqueur popular in Finland. Traditionally, the cocktail consisted of Koskenkorva Viina vodka with salmiakki extract dissolved into it. Sometimes, ground-up Tyrkisk Peber is used instead of the extract.\n\nSalmiakki Koskenkorva is a somewhat viscous black liquid, or a dark grayish brown when of a thinner consistency. Upon closer inspection, very fine particles of carbon black are visibly suspended in the liquid.\nBefore the 1990s, Finland had a very thin and stratified cocktail culture. Some Finnish bars started serving a cocktail made out of ground ammonium chloride-based candy (Salmiakki in Finnish). It became a trendy drink, especially among young people, and for this reason it still has a reputation as a \"teenagers' vodka\".\nOnly anecdotal evidence exists regarding the origin and the recipe of the beverage. The concept of mixing vodka and liquorice probably existed long before the 1990s, since both Koskenkorva Viina and Tyrkisk Peber were around before the alleged invention of the cocktail. On the other hand, Salmiakki Koskenkorva was one of the first pre-mixed cocktails sold in Finland. A well-known anecdote says that singer Jari Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 invented the drink when he was working as a bartender in the late 1980s.\nThe taste of Salmiakki Koskenkorva strongly resembles that of black liquorice and cough medicine. This is because one of the popular brands of salmiakki used for the drink, Apteekin Salmiakki, is also used in cough medicines. It has the additional effect of increasing salivation.",

        "summary": "Terremoto is a traditional Chilean cocktail created at the end of the 20th century. It can be recognized as a derivative of punch to the Roman style. The name, which literally means earthquake, is due to the fact that it was invented after the 1985 earthquake in Chile. Although its origin is not confirmed and many claim its creation, this drink has been widely popularized in Chilean popular culture by the bars La Piojera, Rinc\u00f3n de los canallas, and El Hoyo.\nThe drink is mainly made up of white Pipe\u00f1o wine or non-denominated white wine (generic wine of any strain), pineapple ice cream and grenadine. In its traditional presentation (a 400 ml glass approximately) it has the name terremoto (earthquake). A half-size terremoto served after the first is sometimes referred to as an aftershock. The large jug is popularly known as Cataclismo, the small glass repetition is known as R\u00e9plica and the small glass before (or if it is the only one) is known as Temblor, the version with red wine is known as Africano or Terremoto Africano.",

The story goes that the drink was created to honor his election, and the city's Ward 8 which historically delivered him a winning margin. In 1915 the Santa Clara Company registered \"Ward 8\" as a trademark with the United States Patent Office claiming use since November 1912  and published a notice that they would prosecute any infringement. During prohibition the Daily Boston Globe reported that the drink was believed to have originated at the \"old\" and abandoned Quincy House. Competing but unfounded myths abound in print and on the Internet. One story reports that it originated in New York in an area known for political corruption, another that the cocktail is a traditional drink of the Scots Guards.",

Because most of the flavor in the wine is obscured by the fruit and sugar, the wine used in wine coolers tends to be of the cheapest available grade. Since January 1991, when the United States Congress quintupled the excise tax on wine, most producers of wine coolers dropped wine from the mix, substituting it with cheaper malt liquor. These malt-based coolers, while sometimes referred to as \"wine coolers\", are in a different category of beverage\u2014sometimes called \"malt beverage\", \"malternative\", or just \"cooler\". Bartles & Jaymes refers to its malt beverage as a \"flavored malt cooler\".In Germany, wine coolers became popular in 2004, when the German government imposed an extra duty on alcopops (pre-mixed spirits) of 0.80 to 0.90 euro per bottle, effective 1 August 2004. To circumvent higher taxation, some German producers have switched to wine coolers, which are being marketed in the same way as alcopops.",

        "summary": "Zurracapote (sometimes abbreviated as zurra) is a popular Spanish alcoholic mixed drink, similar to sangr\u00eda. It consists of red wine mixed with fruit such as peaches and lemons, sugar, and cinnamon. The concoction is then traditionally left to steep for several days, though some recipes call for the addition of other alcoholic beverages, juices, and fruit extracts. The result is a mild-to-medium alcoholic drink, similar to sangr\u00eda.\nThe drink is normally prepared in large receptacles during local festivals with many local variations in recipe. It was first drunk in Calahorra, where \"Pe\u00f1a Phillips\" developed the recipe through several competitions. It is the typical drink of the La Rioja area and nearby areas such as northern Burgos, Soria, Ribera Navarra, and the Basque Country. It is also prepared in other Spanish provinces, such as Albacete, northern Granada, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, and Guadalajara.",

        "summary": "Arabic coffee is a version of the brewed coffee of Coffea arabica beans. Most Arab countries throughout the Middle East have developed distinct methods for brewing and preparing coffee. Cardamom is an often-added spice, but it can alternatively be served plain or with sugar.\nThere are several different styles to brewing the coffee depending on the preference of the drinker. Some methods keep the coffee light whereas others can make it dark. Arabic coffee is bitter, and typically no sugar is added. It is usually served in a small cup that is adorned with a decorative pattern, known as a finj\u0101n. Culturally, Arabic coffee is served during family gatherings or when receiving guests.\nArabic coffee is ingrained within Middle Eastern and Arab culture and tradition, and is the most popular form of coffee brewed in the Middle East. It originated in the Middle East, beginning in Yemen and eventually travelling to Mecca (Hejaz), Egypt, the Levant, and then, in the mid-16th century, to Turkey and from there to Europe where coffee eventually became popular as well. Arabic coffee is an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Arab states confirmed by UNESCO.",

        "summary": "Asbach Uralt is a German brandy produced by the company Asbach GmbH, a subsidiary of Underberg AG, which also makes other spirits and chocolate. Its history dates back to 1892 when Hugo Asbach (1868\u20131935) founded the company in the town of R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein.\nAsbach, a native from Cologne, learned the distillery trade at the local \"Export-Company for German Cognac\" and further improved his knowledge in France. He founded his own company on 11 May 1892, distributing domestic \"R\u00fcdesheim Cognac\" which soon became popular. After World War I, when the Treaty of Versailles decreed that the word Cognac could only be used for French products, Hugo Asbach coined the term Weinbrand for German brandy, which in 1923 became an official classification according to German wine law.\nFrom 1924, Asbach also distributed brandy filled pralines (\"brandy beans\") to address new customer demographics.\nThe coffee drink R\u00fcdesheimer Kaffee, invented in 1957, contains Asbach as its alcoholic ingredient. Up to today, Asbach Uralt is one of the best-known German brandy trademarks. As a long drink, it is often mixed with Cola products; especially in traditional pubs in the Berlin area, where it is served as Futschi.",

It is known as 'beaten' as the process involves beating the coffee and sugar together with a spoon to aerate into a light brown fluffy paste-like substance. It is generally served with warm milk, which creates a thick froth on the top. Another popular way of serving it is by pouring the paste on top of a cup of warm or cold milk.\nBeaten coffee can be prepared without any special machines or coffee mixes. Coffee is beaten with milk, hot water, and sugar, incorporating air into the paste until frothy. As milk is added, the coffee is further dissolved and air is released creating a creamy texture. This method of hand-beating is what gives the coffee the name \"Beaten Coffee\".",

Similar to Irish coffee, it is typical of Spain and several Latin American countries, such as Colombia and Venezuela, where it is usually made with brandy; Cuba, where it is usually made with rum; and in Mexico where mezcal or a coffee liqueur such as Kahl\u00faa or T\u00eda Mar\u00eda may be used. Spices such as cinnamon and fruit such as lemon peel are commonly added to more elaborate versions in Spain.  Carajillo is usually served in a small glass.\nAccording to folk etymology, its origin dates to the times when Cuba was a Spanish province. The troops combined coffee with rum to give them courage. Spanish coraje means courage, and its diminutive form is corajillo, later changing to carajillo, while carajo is an expletive in Spanish. In Catalan, the carajillo is called cigal\u00f3. A similar Italian drink is known as caff\u00e8 corretto.",

Newport Creamery, a chain of family restaurants found almost exclusively in Rhode Island, serve a variation of cabinets made with ice milk under the brand name \"Awful Awful\". A cabinet is often referred to elsewhere in New England as a frappe.\n\nThe earliest known reference to the Coffee Cabinet was published in The Spatula in 1903:A drink that has become the most popular is \"Coffee Cabinet,\" consisting of coffee syrup, egg, plain cream, ice cream, and shaved ice, thoroughly shaken. The coarse stream of soda is drawn and the drink is strained. This has often been called a meal in itself.\nAs with downcity, the etymology of this term is unknown. One common, but unsubstantiated, explanation is that the soda jerk or pharmacist kept the coffee syrup in one of the polished wooden cabinets behind the counter. It has also been theorized by some that the name was a variation on a drink known as the Royal Cabinet, an egg cream first popularized in Chicago.",

It may be prepared either by brewing coffee normally (i.e. carafe, French press, etc.) and then serving it over ice or in cold milk or by brewing the coffee cold. In hot brewing, sweeteners and flavoring may be added before cooling, as they dissolve faster. Iced coffee can also be sweetened with pre-dissolved sugar in water.\nIced coffee is regularly available in most coffee shops. Iced coffee is generally brewed at a higher strength than normal coffee, given that it is diluted by the melting ice. In Australia, \"iced coffee\" is a common term for packaged coffee-flavored and sweetened milk beverage.",

        "summary": "Kopi (Chinese: \u35dd\u5478; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: ko-pi), also known as Nanyang coffee, is a traditional coffee beverage found in several Maritime Southeast Asian nations. Often brewed to be highly caffeinated in strength, it is commonly served with sugar and/or milk-based condiments. This drink originated from the British Malaya era, with Hainanese cultural roots. The name of the drink is derived from the Malay term for coffee. The term Nanyang, which means \"South Sea\" in Mandarin, refers to Maritime Southeast Asia. Kopi culture vocabulary is grounded in Hokkien dialect as a result of historical immigration to Maritime Southeast Asia from the Minnan region in the south-eastern part of Fujian Province in Southeastern Mainland China. The beverage is usually served in coffee shops, Hawker centres and kopitiams across the region.In Singapore, kopi is recognized as culturally significant and part of the everyday diet and lifestyle of many Singaporeans. It is habitual for Singaporeans of all ethnicities and ages to customize their Kopi using the Hokkien dialect. The Singapore coffee is distinct from other types of coffee due to its roasting process and preparation technique involving a variation of the Torrefacto method.  Coffee consumption thus offers a medium for performing an ambivalent (g)local version of what it means to be a Singaporean.  Concerns over the elevation of diabetes cases, have caused the creation of government-led nationwide campaigns in Singapore to reduce sugar intake, especially with regard to sweet drinks or drinks that add sugar such as Kopi O. This has the potential to affect the consumption of Kopi O. The significance of Kopi in Singapore's culture can be found in greater detail in Singapore's only Kopi museum.Kopi is also a popular drink in Brunei, Malaysia, and Southern Thailand. Tenom in the East Malaysian state of Sabah is a major regional producer of coffee beans, which is used to brew kopi.",

Ordering a Wiener Melange may yield the arrival of an espresso con panna even in Vienna, though this is properly called a Franziskaner (Franciscan friar).

        "summary": "Algerian wine is wine cultivated and bottled in Algeria. It has played an important role in the history of wine. Algeria's viticultural history dates back to its settlement by the Phoenicians and continued under the Roman empire. Prior to the Algerian War of Independence (1954-1962), Algeria was the largest wine exporter in the world, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total international wine trade.Algeria has a long history of wine production dating back to the Roman era. During the late 19th century, Algeria's wine production peaked and it became the largest wine-producing country in the world, with an annual production of over 3 billion liters of wine. At the time, Algeria was a French colony and much of the wine produced in Algeria was exported to France to be used for blending with French wines.Most Algerian wine production takes place in the regions of Mascara, Mostaganem, and Tiaret, which are located in the northwest of the country. The most commonly grown grape varieties in Algeria include Carignan, Grenache, Cinsault, and Alicante Bouschet, which are used to produce both red and ros\u00e9 wines.Algerian wines are known for their deep color, rich aroma, and full-bodied flavor. The climate and soil in Algeria are well-suited for grape cultivation, with warm, sunny summers and mild winters. In 2019, Algeria produced approximately 500,000 hectoliters of wine, making it one of the largest wine-producing countries in Africa. Most of this wine is exported to other countries, including France, Italy, and Spain, where it is used for blending and sold under other labels.With as much land under vineyards as the countries of Germany and South Africa, Algeria continues to maintain a wine industry with over 70 wineries in operation. \nDespite the challenges facing the Algerian wine industry, there is a growing interest in producing higher quality wines and promoting Algerian wine as a unique and distinct product. Some producers are experimenting with new grape varieties and modern winemaking techniques, while others are focusing on marketing their wines to a domestic audience. As a result, there may be potential for growth and innovation in Algerian wine production in the future.",

        "summary": "Argentina is the fifth largest producer of wine in the world. Argentine wine, as with some aspects of Argentine cuisine, has its roots in Spain. During the Spanish colonization of the Americas, vine cuttings were brought to Santiago del Estero in 1557, and the cultivation of the grape and wine production stretched first to neighboring regions, and then to other parts of the country.Historically, Argentine winemakers were traditionally more interested in quantity than quality with the country consuming 90% of the wine it produces (45 liters per year or 12 U.S. gallons per year per capita according to 2006 figures). Until the early 1990s, Argentina produced more wine than any other country outside Europe, though the majority of it was considered unexportable. However, the desire to increase exports fueled significant advances in quality. Argentine wines started being exported during the 1990s, and are currently growing in popularity, making it now the largest wine exporter in South America. The devaluation of the Argentine peso in 2002 further fueled the industry as production costs decreased and tourism significantly increased, giving way to a whole new concept of enotourism in Argentina.The most important wine regions of the country are located in the provinces of Mendoza, San Juan and La Rioja. Salta, Catamarca, R\u00edo Negro and more recently southern Buenos Aires are also wine producing regions. The Mendoza province produces more than 60% of the Argentine wine and is the source of an even higher percentage of the total exports. Due to the high altitude and low humidity of the main wine producing regions, Argentine vineyards rarely face the problems of insects, fungi, molds and other grape diseases that affect vineyards in other countries. This allows cultivating with little or no pesticides, enabling even organic wines to be easily produced.There are many different varieties of grapes cultivated in Argentina, reflecting the country's many immigrant groups. The French brought Malbec, which makes most of Argentina's best known wines. The Italians brought vines that they called Bonarda, although Argentine Bonarda appears to be the Douce noir of Savoie, also known as Charbono in California. It has nothing in common with the light fruity wines made from Bonarda Piemontese in Piedmont. Torront\u00e9s is another typically Argentine grape and is mostly found in the provinces of La Rioja, San Juan, and Salta. It is a member of the Malvasia group that makes aromatic white wines. It has recently been grown in Spain. Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Chardonnay and other international varieties are becoming more widely planted, but some varieties are cultivated characteristically in certain areas.In November 2010, the Argentine government declared wine as Argentina's national liquor.",

        "summary": "The Australian wine industry is one of the world's largest exporters of wine, with approximately 800 million out of the 1.2 to 1.3 billion litres produced annually exported to overseas markets. The wine industry is a significant contributor to the Australian economy through production, employment, export, and tourism.There is a $3.5 billion domestic market for Australian wines, with Australians consuming approximately 500 million litres annually. Norfolk Islanders are the second biggest per capita wine consumers in the world with 54 litres. Only 16.6% of wine sold domestically is imported.Wine is produced in every state, with more than 60 designated wine regions totalling approximately 160,000 hectares; however Australia's wine regions are mainly in the southern, cooler parts of the country, with vineyards located in South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland. The wine regions in each of these states produce different wine varieties and styles that take advantage of the particular Terroir such as: climatic differences, topography and soil types. The major varieties are predominantly Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot, Semillon, Pinot noir, Riesling, and Sauvignon blanc. Wines are often labelled with the name of their grape variety, which must constitute at least 85 percent of the wine.",

        "summary": "Austrian wines are mostly dry white wines (often made from the Gr\u00fcner Veltliner grape), though some sweeter white wines (such as dessert wines made around the Neusiedler See) are also produced. About 30% of the wines are red, made from Blaufr\u00e4nkisch (also known as Lemberger, or as K\u00e9kfrankos in neighbouring Hungary), Pinot noir and locally bred varieties such as Zweigelt. Four thousand years of winemaking history counted for little after the \"antifreeze scandal\" of 1985, when it was revealed that some wine brokers had been adulterating their wines with diethylene glycol. The scandal destroyed the market for Austrian wine and compelled Austria to tackle low standards of bulk wine production, and reposition itself as a producer of quality wines. The country is also home to Riedel, makers of some of the most expensive wine glasses in the world. Some of the best producers of Austria include Weingut Br\u00fcndlmayer, Weingut F.X. Pichler and Weingut Franz Hirtzberger, Weingut Hutter, Weingut Eigl and Wellanschitz.",

Prior to 20th century communist rule, the region which makes up modern-day Azerbaijan had produced wine since the second millennium BC. The territory of modern-day Azerbaijan has a long history of wine production, that was rediscovered at archaeological digs of settlements in K\u00fclt\u0259p\u0259, Qaraba\u011flarSince the fall of Communism and the restoration of Azerbaijani independence, ardent attempts have been made to revive and modernize the Azerbaijani wine industry. Today vineyards are found in the foothills of Caucasus Mountains as well and the Kur-Araz lowlands near the Kura River. In the 21st century, Ganja, Nakhchivan, and the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh controlled by the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh have emerged as centers of wine production in the region. Among the grape varieties used to produce Azerbaijani wine include Pinot noir, Rkatsiteli, Pinot blanc, Aligote and Matrassa. Local grape varieties indigenous to Azerbaijan and neighbouring regions include White Shani, Bayanshire and Madrasa.",

The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) was founded in 1971; however, it was 10 years before the first new brewery, Hilden Brewing, opened its doors.\nMost microbreweries in Northern Ireland find it difficult to sell beer in draught form due to the local tied-pubs issues, where most pubs are owned by Diageo (Guinness), C&C Group (Tennent's) or Molson Coors Brewing Company.",

It is the Thai importer of Guinness and Kilkenny.Boon Rawd Brewery also makes Leo, a standard lager, and Thai Beverages Archa, a mass-market, non-premium lager. Boon Rawd Brewery also sold a global brand called Mittweida, but this was replaced by a beer brewed in partnership with InBev, Kloster. It also sells a 6.5 percent lager called Thai Beer.\nOther Thai beers are Phuket Beer and Siam, both in Pathum Thani Province. Siam Beer exports Bangkok Beer abroad, but does not sell it in Thailand. Phuket Beer and Federbr\u00e4u are the only Thai beers brewed in accordance with the German purity law, the Reinheitsgebot. Phuket Lager received the first gold medal ever for a beer from Thailand at the 2006 Monde Selection Awards. Klassik beer is another local beer brewed in Pathum Thani Province.\nForeign beers are not very popular in Thailand, mainly because the government protects its domestic breweries by the imposition of import duties up to 60 percent. In addition, all imported beer must bear an import sticker on the bottle cap. As a result, Thai brewers have entered into partnerships with Western brewers, such as Carlsberg's with Thai Beverages and  Asahi's with Boon Rawd.",

In the mid-19th century, French wine varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Carmen\u00e8re, and Franc were introduced. During the early 1980s, the Chilean wine industry underwent a renaissance with the introduction of stainless steel fermentation tanks and the use of oak barrels for aging. This led to a rapid growth in exports as quality wine production increased. The number of wineries in Chile rose from 12 in 1995 to over 70 in 2005.The late 20th century saw a large number of French immigrants settling in Chile, bringing with them extensive viticultural knowledge. Today, Chile stands as the fifth largest exporter of wine globally and the seventh largest producer. The climate in Chile has been described as a fusion of the climates in California and France. The most commonly grown grape variety in the country are Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Carmen\u00e8re. Chile is also fortunate to remain free of the phylloxera louse, which means that its grapevines do not require grafting with phylloxera-resistant rootstocks.",

First crafted in the mid-1800s at various breweries in the United States, cream ale remained a very localized form with different styles until the early 20th century. During Prohibition in the United States, a great number of Canadian brewers took up brewing cream ale, refining it to some degree. Following the end of Prohibition, cream ale from Canada became popular in the United States and the style was produced anew in both nations.",

Like other old world wine producers, many traditional grape varieties still survive in Croatia, perfectly suited to their local wine hills. Modern wine-production methods have taken over in the larger wineries and EU-style wine regulations have been adopted, guaranteeing the quality of the wine.\nThere are currently over 300 geographically defined wine regions and a strict classification system to ensure quality and origin. The majority of Croatian wine is white, with most of the remainder being red and only a small percentage being ros\u00e9 wines. In 2014, Croatia ranked 32nd in wine production by country with an estimated 45,272 tonnes.Wine is a popular drink in Croatia, and locals traditionally like to drink wine with their meals. Quite often, the wine is diluted with either still or sparkling water\u2014producing a drinks known as gemi\u0161t (a combination of white wine and carbonated water) and bevanda (a combination of red wine and still water).",

        "summary": "The production of wine in Ethiopia can be traced to the early centuries of the first millennium A.D. The historian Richard Pankhurst observed that early references to Axumite wine can be found in one of the stele erected by the 4th century ruler Ezana. Aksumite viticulture is also attested to by carvings on the base of the great 3rd century obelisk at Axum. The traditional honey wine tej has also long been widely popular.\nContemporary viticulture in Ethiopia dates to 1956, to the establishment of the Awash Winery by entrepreneur Mulugeta Tesfakiros and Ras Mesfin Sileshi. As of 2014 the Awash winery had an annual output of 10 million bottles, most of which is consumed locally. In 2014 the French beverage corporation Castel began producing wines of a number of varieties on a 120-hectare estate near Ziway in the Ethiopian Rift Valley. As of 2013 annual production was 3 million bottles, approximately half of which was exported, mainly to China.Climatic and geographic conditions in the central portion of its Great Rift Valley make Ethiopia well suited to viticulture. Annual rainfall measures about 650 mm, temperatures average 25 degrees Celsius per year and the region enjoys sandy soils, which are ideal conditions for wine production. Furthermore, due to Ethiopia's proximity to the equator, it is possible to make two harvests per year. The western slopes of the Ethiopian Highlands also enjoy an inland Mediterranean climate, also conducive to wine-growing.",

The science of fermentation is known as zymology or zymurgy.\nThe term \"fermentation\" sometimes refers specifically to the chemical conversion of sugars into ethanol, producing alcoholic drinks such as wine, beer, and cider. However, similar processes take place in the leavening of bread (CO2 produced by yeast activity), and in the preservation of sour foods with the production of lactic acid, such as in  sauerkraut and yogurt.\nOther widely consumed fermented foods include vinegar, olives, and cheese. More localised foods prepared by fermentation may also be based on beans, grain, vegetables, fruit, honey, dairy products, and fish.",

Due to millennia of winemaking and the prominent economic role it retains in Georgia to the present day, wine and viticulture are entwined with Georgia's national identity.In 2013, UNESCO added the ancient traditional Georgian winemaking method using the Kvevri clay jars to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. The best-known Georgian wine regions are in the country's east, such as Kakheti (further divided into the micro-regions of Telavi and Kvareli) and Kartli, but also in Imereti, Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti, and coastal areas like Adjara and Abkhazia.",

Its strength typically ranges from 3.8% to 4.8% alcohol by volume, although some craft varieties can be as high as 6%.In the United States, \"Irish red\" is sometimes used to describe a darker amber ale or a \"red\" beer that is a lager with caramel colouring. However, these beers are not Irish red ales.",

A Napa County wine rated best in each category, which caused surprise as France was generally regarded as being the foremost producer of the world's best wines.  By the early 1970s, the quality of some California wines was outstanding but few took notice as the market favored French brands. Spurrier sold predominately French wine and believed the California wines would not win.The event's informal name \"Judgment of Paris\" is an allusion to the ancient Greek myth.",

This is an important issue, since wine is used in several Jewish ceremonies, especially those of Kiddush.\nTo be considered kosher, Sabbath-observant Jews must supervise the entire winemaking process and handle much of it in person, from the time the grapes are loaded into the crusher until the finished wine product is bottled and sealed. Additionally, any ingredients used, including finings, must be kosher. Wine that is described as \"kosher for Passover\" must have been kept free from contact with leavened or fermented grain products, a category that includes many industrial additives and agents.When kosher wine is produced, marketed, and sold commercially, it would normally have a hechsher (kosher certification mark) issued by a kosher certification agency, or by an authoritative rabbi who is respected and known to be learned in Jewish law, or by the Kashruth Committee working under a beth din (rabbinical court of Judaism).\nIn recent times, there has been an increased demand for kosher wines, and a number of wine-producing countries now produce a wide variety of sophisticated kosher wines under strict rabbinical supervision, particularly in Israel, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Chile, and Australia. Two of the world's largest producers and importers of kosher wines\u2014Kedem and Manischewitz\u2014are both based in the American Northeast.",

To keep the alcohol content low, one of two methods may be used: either the yeast is added at about 0 \u00b0C (resulting in an alcohol content of under 0.5% ABV) or fermentation is halted at the desired alcohol content (usually in the range of 1 to 2% ABV). It is made from barley malt syrup, sugar, yeast, hops, and water.Malt beer is considered to be nutritious and is sometimes given to breastfeeding mothers. Among the ancient Egyptians, their form of malt beer (zythum) was considered to work as both a laxative and antidiarrheal; it was considered dangerous, however, for the sick or pregnant to drink it.\nIn the United Kingdom, Danish malt drinks have become popular amongst the South Asian community and have been sold in their dedicated supermarkets since the 1970s.After soft drinks, malt beer is one of the most popular beverages sold in Iceland. The two main brands are Egils Maltextrakt (1.2% ABV) and V\u00edking Malt\u00f6l (0.9% ABV). Additionally, a seasonal hv\u00edt\u00f6l is available in the Christmas month (2.2% ABV). The Icelandic malt beer was modelled on the Danish malt\u00f8l, which is still brewed by at least one company in Denmark.In Southern Brazil, with its large communities of German immigrants, a brand called Brahma Malzbier is very popular and it is mainly consumed during the winter months. \nIn Israel, brands include Nesher Malt, Malt Star and Malti.Varieties of malt beer are also popular in some Caribbean countries.\nWest African brands include Guinness Malt, Amstel Malt, Maltex, and Malteni.

New Zealand is best known for its Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, and more recently its dense, concentrated Pinot Noir from Marlborough, Martinborough and Central Otago.While New Zealand wine traces its history to the early 19th century, the modern wine industry in New Zealand began in the mid-20th century and expanded rapidly in the early 21st century, growing by 17% a year from 2000 to 2020. In 2020, New Zealand produced 329 million litres (87,000,000 US gal) from 39,935 hectares (98,680 acres) of vineyard area, of which 25,160 ha (about two-thirds) is dedicated to Sauvignon Blanc.

        "summary": "Polish wine (Polish: Polskie wino) viticulture and origins have a history dating back to the nation's founding in the tenth century under the Piast dynasty.  Like other old world wine producers, many traditional grape varieties still survive in Poland, perfectly suited to their local wine hills. The most popular varieties of grapes for the production of red wine are Regent, Rondo, Pinot Noir, Mar\u00e9chal Foch, Cabernet Cortis, Tryumf Alzacji, Cascade, and Dornfelder. For white wine production, Solaris, Riesling, Seyval Blanc, Pinot Gris, Johanniter, Jutrzenka, Hibernal, Aurora, Bianka, Traminer, and Siberia are mostly used.  Following the Second World War, most wineries were nationalized under the Polish People's Republic communist regime. After the collapse of communism and return to capitalism, the market economy returned, international wine companies moved back in and a period of consolidation followed. Modern wine-production methods have taken over in the larger wineries, and EU-style wine regulations have been adopted, guaranteeing the quality of the wine. Today, wine production in Poland is an industry with 151 officially registered wineries (2016/2017 season) to sell and produce grape table wines in Poland as defined by the national wine laws that came into being in 2008 and were updated later on.Some of the oldest wineries are Winnica Equus, Adoria Vineyards, Winnica Jaworek, Winnica Maria Anna, Winnica P\u0142ochockich, Winnica Stara Winna G\u00f3ra, Winnica Mi\u0142osz, Winnica Wzg\u00f3rza Trzebnickie. There exists a very lively winery and viticulture scene throughout the country with especially strong grouping in the regions near the city of Zielona G\u00f3ra and in the west of the country, Wroc\u0142aw in the south-west, Krak\u00f3w in the south, the Podkarpacie region and Kazimierz Dolny in south-east. There are also a few wineries in the \"Northern Poland\" wine region. Winnica Jura, a new project of establishing a 6 hectare organic vineyard is currently underway near Krak\u00f3w.Scientists in the American National Academy of Sciences foresee significant global warming in the coming years. As a result, by 2050 Poland may have become a leading global wine producer, while vineyards in the south of Italy and Spain may disappear due to drought.",

In pre-Roman Gallaecia-Lusitania times, the native peoples only drank beer and were unfamiliar with wine production. Portugal started to export its wines to Rome during the Roman Empire. Modern exports developed with trade to England after the Methuen Treaty in 1703. From this commerce a wide variety of wines started to be grown in Portugal. In 1758, one of the first wine-producing regions of the world, the Regi\u00e3o Demarcada do Douro was created under the orientation of Marquis of Pombal, in the Douro Valley. Portugal has two wine-producing regions protected by UNESCO as World Heritage: the Douro Valley Wine Region (Douro Vinhateiro) and Pico Island Wine Region (Ilha do Pico Vinhateira). Portugal has a big variety of local kinds, producing a very wide variety of different wines with distinctive personality.",

Root beer is typically, but not exclusively, non-alcoholic, caffeine-free, sweet, and carbonated. Like cola, it usually has a thick and foamy head. A common use is to add vanilla ice cream to make a root beer float.\nSince safrole, a key component of sassafras, was banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1960 due to its carcinogenicity, most commercial root beers have been flavored using artificial sassafras flavoring, but a few (e.g. Hansen's) use a safrole-free sassafras extract.Major root beer producers include PepsiCo, Coca-Cola Company, Dad's, Keurig Dr. Pepper, and A&W.",

        "summary": "Slovenia has more than 28,000 wineries making between 80 and 90 million litres annually from the country's 22,300 ha of vineyards. About 75% of the country's production is white wine. Almost all of the wine is consumed domestically with only 6.1 million L a year being exported\u2014mostly to the United States, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and lately the Czech Republic. Most of the country's wine production falls under the classification of premium (vrhunsko) wine with less than 30% classified as basic table wine (namizno vino). Slovenia has three principal wine regions: the Drava Wine-Growing Region, the Lower Sava Wine-Growing Region, and the Littoral Wine-Growing Region.Viticulture and winemaking has existed in this region since the time of the Celts and Illyrians tribes, long before the Romans would introduce winemaking to the lands of France, Spain and Germany. In 2016, a research study based on DNA profiling and historical ampelographic sources showed that two international varieties of red grape, the Blaufr\u00e4nkisch and the Blauer Portugieser, likely originate from the Styria region of modern Slovenia.",

        "summary": "Spanish wine (Spanish: vinos espa\u00f1oles) includes red, white, and sparkling wines produced throughout the country. Located on the Iberian Peninsula, Spain has over 1.2 million hectares (2.9 million acres) planted in wine grapes, making it the most widely planted wine-producing nation, but the second largest producer of wine in the world, behind Italy and ahead of France and the United States. This is due, in part, to the very low yields and wide spacing of the old vines planted on the dry soils found in some of the Spanish wine regions. The country is ninth in worldwide consumption with Spaniards drinking, on average, 21.6 litres (5.7 US gal) per person a year. The country has an abundance of native grape varieties, with over 400 varieties planted throughout Spain, though 88 percent of the country's wine production is from only 20 grapes \u2014 including the reds Tempranillo, Bobal, Garnacha, and Monastrell; the whites Albari\u00f1o, Air\u00e9n, Verdejo, Palomino, and Macabeo; and the three Cava grapes Parellada, Xarel\u00b7lo, and Macabeo.\nMajor Spanish wine regions include the Rioja and Ribera del Duero, which are known for their Tempranillo production; Jumilla, known for its Monastrell production; Jerez de la Frontera, the home of the fortified wine Sherry; R\u00edas Baixas in the northwest region of Galicia that is known for its white wines made from Albari\u00f1o and Catalonia which includes the Cava and still wine-producing regions of the Pened\u00e8s as well the Priorat region.",

        "summary": "Spruce beer is a beverage flavored with the buds, needles, or essence of spruce trees. Spruce beer can refer to either alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages.\nA number of flavors are associated with spruce-flavored beverages, ranging from floral, citrus, and fruity, to cola-like flavors to resinous and piney. This diversity in flavor likely comes from the choice of spruce species, the season in which the spruce ingredients are harvested, and the manner of preparation.\nUsing evergreen needles to create beverages was practiced in both Northern Europe and North America. Certain Indigenous peoples of North America used the drink as a cure for scurvy during the winter months when fresh fruits were not available, as the fresh shoots of many spruces and pines are a natural source of vitamin C. It may also have been brewed in Scandinavia prior to European contact with the Americas, but most French and British explorers were ignorant of its use as a treatment for scurvy when they arrived in North America. Jacques Cartier and his explorers were exposed to it as a tea when they arrived in Stadacona in what is now Quebec in 1535. European sailors adopted the practice and subsequently spread it across the world.",

This policy intervention is an effort to decrease obesity and the health impacts related to being overweight. The tax is a matter of public debate in many countries and beverage producers like Coca-Cola often oppose it. Advocates such as national medical associations and the World Health Organization promote the tax as an example of Pigovian taxation, aimed to discourage unhealthy diets and offset the growing economic costs of obesity.",

Due to the addition of bread and use of a fermentation vessel which has been smoked over dried olive wood or Abyssinian rose wood, tella may have a smoky flavour. The alcohol content of unfiltered Tella is usually around 2\u20134 Volume percent, filtered tella contains about 5\u20136 vol%.Tella is often home-brewed. It may be offered in tella houses (tellabet), usually in regular homes, where people meet and talk to each other.Tella was commonly used for kiddush by the Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews). Tella was used because wine was often unavailable. Due to the availability of wine in Israel, Ethiopian-Israelis generally use wine for kiddush instead of tella.",

As a tropical country, Thailand lies well outside the latitudes traditionally regarded as suitable for cultivating grapes for winemaking, though the development of adaptive viticulture techniques have allowed for some success, and Thai wines have become recognized among a growing range of new-latitude wines.\nGrapes had been introduced to Thailand when the French embassy sent by Louis XIV presented specimens of White Malaga (Beba) to King Narai.The grapes were used solely for fruit until well into the twentieth century, when a wine industry started to develop. The majority comes from two regions: Hua Hin on the northwest gulf of Thailand coast and the Khao Yai area in the foothills of the national park of the same name.The grapes are forced by pruning into bearing two crops a year; the fine wines are those that ripen during the (relatively) dry season, while a vin de table is made from the wet season crop. Other vinifera grapes such as Chenin blanc and  Shiraz are becoming popular.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "summary": "Wine and food matching is the process of pairing food dishes with wine to enhance the dining experience. In many cultures, wine has had a long history of being a staple at the dinner table and in some ways both the winemaking and culinary traditions of a region will have evolved together over the years. Rather than following a set of rules, local cuisines were paired simply with local wines. The modern \"art\" of food pairings is a relatively recent phenomenon, fostering an industry of books and media with guidelines for pairings of particular foods and wine. In the restaurant industry, sommeliers are often present to make food pairing recommendations for the guest. The main concept behind pairings is that certain elements (such as texture and flavor) in both food and wine interact with each other, and thus finding the right combination of these elements will make the entire dining experience more enjoyable. However, taste and enjoyment are very subjective and what may be a \"textbook perfect\" pairing for one taster could be less enjoyable to another.While there are many books, magazines and websites with detailed guidelines on how to pair food and wine, most food and wine experts believe that the most basic element of food and wine pairing is understanding the balance between the \"weight\" of the food and the weight (or body) of the wine. Heavy, robust wines like Cabernet Sauvignon can overwhelm a light, delicate dish like a quiche, while light-bodied wines like Pinot Grigio would be similarly overwhelmed by a hearty stew. Beyond weight, flavors and textures can either be contrasted or complemented. From there a food and wine pairing can also take into consideration the sugar, acid, alcohol and tannins of the wine and how they can be accentuated or minimized when paired with certain types of food.",

The release sparked an investigation into caffeine levels in energy drinks by the New Zealand Food Safety Authority. An investigation by the New Zealand Herald found that the drink's caffeine levels were more than ten times the legal limit. In August 2009 a 15-year-old girl collapsed after drinking several of the company's \"Energy Shots\", leading to calls for the drinks to carry mandatory warning labels. The safety of energy drinks was subsequently referred to Food Standards Australia New Zealand.In September 2009 a group of New Zealand soldiers were sent home from Afghanistan after photographing themselves posing with a bomb carrying an advertisement for Demon and sending the photograph to the company. The company denied they had organised the stunt, but admitted supplying free drinks and posters to the soldiers.In May 2012, the drink was introduced in Poland following a license of the brand by Agros Nova.

        "summary": "Nae Danger is an energy drink from Scotland. It is claimed to be the first and only carbonated energy drink to have been created, branded and manufactured in Scotland, which is contested with IrnBru32 which was released in 2006 by A.G. Barr. Released in August 2012, the drink is a creation of Ross Gourlay, a Scottish entrepreneur from Bishopbriggs. Gourlay hoped to gain a slice of the growing caffeinated drinks market and also encourage recognisable Scottish brands within the UK. There are two main flavours: Blue Raspberry and Red Blueberry.The can design includes the words \"Nae Danger\", a popular Scottish phrase equivalent to the Australian \"no worries\", spanning the length of the can. The can also states that it's \"an energy drink like nae other\" and \"it's only a quid\", endorsing the Scottish theme of the product. The company is a new addition to the energy drink market which is worth over \u00a3790 million in the UK having risen 17% between 2012 and 2013. The drink competes with other highly caffeinated energy products such as Relentless, Monster, Rockstar and Red Bull. Nae Danger has culminated an assortment of 6 drinks since its released in mid-2012.",

        "summary": "Red Bull is a brand of energy drinks created and owned by the Austrian company Red Bull GmbH. With a market share of 43%, it is the most popular energy drink brand as of 2020, and the third most valuable soft drink brand, behind Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Sin\u0441e its launch in 1987, more than 100 billion cans of Red Bull have been sold worldwide, including over 12 billion in 2023.Originally available only in a single nondescript flavor sold in a tall and slim silver-blue can, called Red Bull Energy Drink, the drink added numerous variants over time. Its slogan, \"Red Bull Gives You Wings\", is considered one of the most popular and memorable advertising slogans in the world. Rather than following a traditional marketing approach, Red Bull has generated awareness and created a \"brand myth\" through proprietary extreme sport event series such as Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series, Red Bull Air Race, Red Bull Crashed Ice and standout stunts such as the Stratos space diving project. In addition to sport series, its marketing includes multiple sports team ownerships; celebrity endorsements; and music, through its Red Bull Records label.Red Bull was derived from a similar drink called Krating Daeng which originated in Thailand and was introduced by the pharmacist Chaleo Yoovidhya. While doing business in Thailand, Dietrich Mateschitz purchased a can of Krating Daeng and claimed it cured his jet lag. Mateschitz sought to create a partnership with Yoovidhya and formulated a product that would suit the tastes of Westerners, such as by carbonating the drink. In 1984, the two founded Red Bull GmbH in Fuschl am See, Salzburg, Austria. When branding their new product, Mateschitz referenced Krating Daeng's name: in Thai, daeng means red, and a krating (known in English as a gaur or Indian bison) is a large species of wild bovine native to the Indian subcontinent. In 1987, the company sold its first can of Red Bull in Austria. In 1996, Red Bull began operation in the United States, and has seen steady growth ever since. Both Red Bull and Kraeting Daeng use the same red bull on yellow sun logo while continuing to market their drinks separately in the Thai and Western markets.",

        "summary": "Sparks was an alcoholic beverage that debuted in the US market in 2002. The original formulation contained caffeine, one of the first alcoholic beverages to do so. Its other original active ingredients included taurine, ginseng and guarana, common to energy drinks.\nPackaged in a can, its labeling indicates a 6% alcoholic content by volume. Its flavor was similar to other energy drinks such as Red Bull, Monster Energy, and Rockstar, with a tart, sugary taste. Sparks' final formulation did not contain caffeine or taurine. Original packaging was a 16 oz (475 mL) silver can with bright orange tops, with a \"+\" printed near the top and a \"\u2013\" printed near the bottom, intended to be reminiscent of a battery. \nOther varieties included a sugar-free \"Sparks Light\" version with a bright blue top. Higher-alcohol versions, named \"Sparks Plus\" (black top, 7% alcohol), \"Sparks Red\" (red top, 8% alcohol), and \"Sparks Stinger\" (yellow top, 8% alcohol) are packaged in both 16oz and 24oz cans. Sparks rolled out an iced tea, lemonade and blackberry flavor in the early 2010s but quickly shrank their product line to only two flavors- original orange and blackberry. Those two flavors were available until August 2021 when current owners, Molson Coors, decided to discontinue the orange and blackberry flavors (the only two that existed at the time). A representative stopped short of saying the brand would be dissolved, but as it stands SPARKS has reached the end of their nearly two decade run.",

        "summary": "Aqua vitae  (Latin for \"water of life\") or aqua vita is an archaic name for a concentrated aqueous solution of ethanol. These terms could also be applied to weak ethanol without rectification. Usage was widespread during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, although its origin is likely much earlier. This Latin term appears in a wide array of dialectical forms throughout all lands and people conquered by ancient Rome. The term is a generic name for all types of distillates, and eventually came to refer specifically to distillates of alcoholic beverages (liquors).Aqua vitae was typically prepared by distilling wine and in English texts was also called  ardent spirits, spirit of wine, or spirits of wine, a name that could be applied to brandy that had been repeatedly distilled.\nThe term was used by the 14th-century alchemist John of Rupescissa, who believed the then newly discovered substance of ethanol to be an imperishable and life-giving \"fifth essence\" or quintessence, and who extensively studied its medical properties.Aqua vitae was often an etymological source of terms applied to important locally produced distilled spirits. Examples include whisky (from the Gaelic uisce beatha),  eau de vie in France, acquavite in Italy, and akvavit in Scandinavia, okowita in Poland, \u043e\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0430 (okovyta) in Ukraine, \u0430\u043a\u0430\u0432\u0456\u0442\u0430 (akavita) in Belarus, and \u044f\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0430 (yakovita) in southern Russian dialects.",

Daniel Defoe commented: \"the Distillers have found out a way to hit the palate of the Poor, by their new fashion'd compound Waters called Geneva, so that the common People seem not to value the French-brandy as usual, and even not to desire it\".Parliament passed five major Acts, in 1729, 1736, 1743, 1747 and 1751, designed to control the consumption of gin. Though many similar drinks were available and alcohol consumption was considerable at all levels of society, gin caused the greatest public concern. Although it is commonly thought gin or Jenever was the singular drink, \"gin\" was a blanket statement for all grain-based alcohols at the time.",

        "summary": "A microdistillery is a small, often boutique-style distillery established to produce beverage grade spirit alcohol in relatively small quantities, usually done in single batches (as opposed to larger distillers' continuous distilling process). While the term is most commonly used in the United States, micro-distilleries have been established in Europe for many years, either as small cognac distilleries supplying the larger cognac houses, or as distilleries of single malt whisky originally produced for the blended Scotch whisky market, but whose products are now sold as niche single malt brands. The more recent development of micro-distilleries can now also be seen in locations as diverse as London, Switzerland, and South Africa.\nThroughout much of the world, small distilleries operate throughout communities of various sizes, mostly without being given a special description. Due to the extended period of Prohibition in the United States, however, most small distillers were forced out of business, leaving only the corporate-dominated megadistilleries to resume operation when Prohibition was repealed to produce small batch brands. Most microdistilleries in South Africa ceased to exist when legislation was introduced in 1964 that made it almost impossible for small, private distilleries to operate viably. The legislation was relaxed again in 2003 and although most distilling expertise was lost, it was recovered by a new generation of microdistillers and has grown since.\nA recent trend in this segment of the distilling industry is for megadistillers to create their own micro-distillery within their current operation. The Makers Mark distillery is owned by Suntory and the Buffalo Trace distillery is owned by The Sazerac Company (which also owns the A. Smith Bowman microdistillery) are now producing specialty bourbon brands with small stills.",

        "summary": "Old Tom Gin (or Tom Gin or Old Tom) is a gin recipe popular in 18th-century England. In modern times, it became rare but has experienced a resurgence in the craft cocktail movement. It is slightly sweeter than London Dry, but slightly drier than the Dutch Jenever, thus is sometimes called \"the missing link\".The name Old Tom Gin purportedly came from wooden plaques shaped like a black cat (an \"Old Tom\") mounted on the outside wall of some pubs above a public walkway in 18th-century England. Owing to the Gin Craze, the British government tried to stem the flow of gin with prohibitive taxes and licensing, which drove the scene underground. Under the cat's paw sign were a slot to put money in and a lead tube. From the tube would come a shot of gin, poured by the bartender inside the pub.Old Tom Gin was formerly made under licence by a variety of distillers around the world; however, one was recently relaunched by Hayman's Distillery based on an original recipe. Since then a number of other companies have followed suit, such as: Booth's; Secret Treasures; The Liberty Distillery; Tanqueray; Langley's; Jensens; Ransom; Master of Malt; The Dorchester Hotel; The London Distillery Company Ltd; Cotswolds Distillery, and Sacred Spirits.An Old Tom Gin made by J. Wray and Nephew Ltd. of Jamaica is also commonly found on the market.\nOld Tom Gin is specified for Jerry Thomas' cocktail called the Martinez in his 1887 Bartender's Guide, How to Mix All Kinds of Plain and Fancy Drinks. An early record of it being used in the Tom Collins cocktail was the 1888 book, Harry Johnson's New and Improved Bartender's Manual.",

For this reason, it has traditionally been called the \"Black Friars Distillery\", and this name appears embossed on the gin bottles. The taste profile of the style has been described as \"earthy\", and featuring more citrus notes than the \"London Dry\" gin style, of which Plymouth Gin is considered an offshoot, or subtype.Plymouth Gin was the only spirit made in England, and one of only three gins in the world, that carried a geographical indication (GI) designation with the European Union, certifying its traditional origin. In 2015, the distillery's owners declined to pursue renewal of the GI, considering its protection was unneeded. This leaves only Gin de Mah\u00f3n from Spain and Vilniaus D\u017einas (Vilnius gin) from Lithuania to carry GI status.",

By edict of 1688, the \"Great Elector\" Frederick William of Brandenburg, in his capacity as Count of Ravensberg, granted the inhabitants of Steinhagen the exclusive privilege to distil liquor. During the 19th century, about 20 companies were founded in the village; today, only two manufacturers (H. W. Schlichte established in 1766 and Zum F\u00fcrstenhof, a subsidiary of Kisker Distilleries in Halle since 1955) still produce gin.\nSteinh\u00e4ger is typically sold in long brown earthenware (Steingut) bottles and in glass bottles made to look like earthenware. Since 1989, the Steinh\u00e4ger geographical indication is protected by a European Economic Community directive. The alcohol content is usually 38% ABV but sometimes higher.

Waragi is also given different names, depending on region of origin, the distillation process, or both. Waragi is known as a form of homemade Gin. The term \"Waragi\" is synonymous with locally distilled gin in all parts of Uganda. However, Uganda Waragi is a particular brand of industrially distilled gin produced by East African Breweries Limited. Other brands of distilled gin which are done by individuals at small scale are also available, but they are also unique and different from each other. The most common are: 1. \"Kasese-Kasese\" which was originally distilled in the district of Kasese in western Uganda and sold all over the country; 2. \"Arege mogo\" which first originated in Lira district in northern Uganda made and sold all over the country as well. These two brands \"waragi\" have different tastes and scents from each other. The distillation process in both cases produce highly distilled gin at the level produced industrially.\nMoonshining and consumption of waragi and other alcoholic beverages is widespread in Uganda. In the 2004 WHO Global Status Report on Alcohol, Uganda ranked as the world's leading consumer of alcohol (per capita). Based on results from 2007, Uganda\u2019s overall alcohol consumption was an average of 17.6 liters per capita. This is unusually high compared to surrounding countries. In 2016 this seems no longer the case, with total consumption of pure alcohol down to 9.5 litres per capita (\u2265 15 years of age).",

        "summary": "A caudle (or caudel) was a hot drink that recurred in various guises throughout British cuisine from the Middle Ages into Victorian times. It was thick and sweet, and seen as particularly suitable and sustaining for invalids and new mothers. At some periods of history, caudle recipes were based on milk and eggs, like eggnog. Later variants were more similar to a gruel, a sort of drinkable oatmeal porridge. Like the original forms of posset (a drink of wine and milk, rather than a set dessert), a caudle was usually alcoholic.\nThere were special caudle cups, larger than teacups, often with a cover, and perhaps two handles. These were either in pottery or metal, and might be given as presents.",

Phosphate beverages were made with fruit flavorings, egg, malt, or wine, in combination with seltzer (carbonated water).  In the 1900s, the beverages became popular, and fruit-flavoured phosphate sodas were served at soda fountains, before losing popularity to ice cream-based treats in the 1930s.Phosphoric acid is used in many bottled soft drinks, including Coca-Cola. The original acid phosphate, made by the Horsford Chemical Company, was a mixture of calcium, magnesium and potassium phosphate salts with a small amount of phosphoric acid producing a liquid mixture with a pH of around 2 to 3, the same as freshly squeezed lime juice.\nHorsford used bone ash, which is mostly calcium phosphate.  In the 21st century, bone ash is used primarily in the ceramics industry, and is rarely available as food grade stock.  The ingredients can, however, be synthesized from modern food-grade chemicals.",

Today, the syrup often is pumped from a special container called a bag-in-box (BiB).\nFountain coke is an often confused term normally referring to a handheld dispenser behind a bar or counter that are used in many countries, including Spain, France and the United Kingdom. The term \u2018fountain\u2019 helps differentiate from, \u2018machine\u2019 cola as the fountain is more easily controlled and offers more flavours.\nA soda fountain is also referred to as a postmix machine in some markets. Any brand of soft drink that is available as postmix syrup may be dispensed by a fountain.\nThe term may also refer to a small eating establishment, soda shop or luncheonette, common from the late 19th century until the mid-20th century, often inside a drugstore, candy store or other business, where a soda jerk served carbonated beverages, ice cream, and sometimes light meals. The soda jerk's fountain generally dispensed only unflavored carbonated water, to which various syrups were added by hand only.",

The original Samoan version as recorded by European colonists in the 1890s was made by mixing grated ambarella fruit (called vi in Samoan language and Tongan, wi in Hawaiian language) and young coconut meat with coconut milk and coconut water. The mixture was poured into large, empty coconut shells corked with coconut husk and allowed to chill in cold pools of water (or behind waterfalls) before serving.\nThe modern Tongan recipe most well-known today is usually a blend of water, shredded coconut meat, and any variety of grated tropical fruits, most commonly watermelon, mango and pineapple, with watermelon being the most used in the Tongan Islands.  Sugar is usually added to taste. Tongan historians have noted this version is a very modern take on the traditional Polynesian \u02bbotai, especially since milk, refined sugar, watermelons, mangos, and pineapples are all introduced, foreign ingredients that were not native to Tonga. The original Tongan recipe was said to be identical to the Samoan recipe, except the preferred native fruit was not ambarella (vi), but the Tongan mountain apple, called fekika. In Samoa, this distinction of \"native\" and \"introduced\" recipes is differentiated as \"\u02bbotai\" only refers to the drink prepared with vi fruit, while the \u02bbotai made with European-introduced fruits are respectively called vai meleni (watermelon drink), vai mago (mango drink), or vai fala (pineapple drink).",

According to the story, he was born \"of lemon extraction\" and seemed like a normal baby, except he was \"shaped like a lemon. And he was yellow. And he was a lemon.\" Unlike other babies, from his crib he made statements such as, \"I think our tax structure is atrocious.\" When he grew up, he desired to become Baron, which he achieved by walking into the General's office and asking for it, pointing out he was the only one in the air force with a plane. He then flew off to see his aunt, leaving the General to figure out how to stop their arch-enemy, Demon Thirst.\nHis fellow flyers were Crash Orange and Sir Reginald Lime-Lime.\nA pack of Baron Von Lemon lemonade sold for 10 cents, and, with water added, made one quart of sugar-free lemonade.\nThe promotional comic is rare; it has never been listed in the annual Overstreet Comic Book Price Guides, although the guides have a separate category for such; and other titles of the same type of book are listed there.",

The brand gained substantial hype in the mid-1990s before enduring lagging sales by decade's end. While still available in Canada and Australia as a juice brand, in 2003, Fruitopia was phased out in most of the United States where it had struggled for several years. However, select flavors have since been revamped under Minute Maid. Use of the Fruitopia brand name continues through various beverages in numerous countries, including some McDonald's restaurant locations in the United States, which carry the drink to this day.",

The drink has a light anise flavor and a distinctive red color. Other ingredients include rum and cane sugar. According to tradition, cucui is served at parties, weddings, Christmas, and dande celebrations. It can be enjoyed neat or with ice and is popular among women.

        "summary": "Goldwasser or Danziger Goldwasser (lit. 'Gold water from Gda\u0144sk'), Polish: W\u00f3dka Gda\u0144ska, with Goldwasser as the registered tradename, is a strong (40% ABV) root and herbal liqueur which was produced from 1598 to 2009 in Gda\u0144sk (German: Danzig). Production now takes place in Germany.The most prominent characteristic of the drink is small flakes of 23 karat gold suspended in it. The beverage also includes herbs and spices such as cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, lavender, thyme, coriander and juniper, and has a syrupy texture.Alcoholic solutions were used by artists for gilding, which is believed to be the inspiration for the drink. Alchemy, which was at its high point in the late 16th century when Goldwasser appeared, held gold to have many desirable medical properties; while modern medicine disputes this, native gold is known to be non-toxic to humans and to pass through the digestive tract unchanged, unlike most other heavy metals. Since the flakes are extremely small and thin, the price is not prohibitive. When used as a food additive, gold is labelled as E175; see List of food additives, Codex Alimentarius.\nThe drink was invented by a Dutchman from De Lier, Ambrosius Vermeulen who moved to Poland and became a citizen of Gda\u0144sk on 6 July 1598. In 1704 Ambrosius' grandson Salomon Verm\u00f6llen and his brother-in-law Isaac Wed-Ling moved production to new premises located in the Breitgasse. At that time it was common for houses to use animal symbols instead of numbers, and the new factory featured a salmon (German: Lachs) on the fa\u00e7ade; hence the naming of the brand \"Der Lachs zu Danzig\".\nDuring his trip to Western Europe \u2014 the so-called Grand Embassy \u2014 Russian Tsar Peter I the Great visited the city of Gda\u0144sk. He founded the official Russian consulate in Gda\u0144sk and became a great lover of Goldwasser. He ordered permanent delivery of Goldwasser to Russia for himself.As the Free City of Gda\u0144sk was separated from Germany after World War I by the Polish corridor, the Der Lachs company opened in 1922 an additional factory in Berlin to supply the main part of Germany and international markets with their products Goldwasser and Krambambuli from there. After 1945, when the city again became part of Poland, only the Berlin factory continued to produce genuine Danziger Goldwasser. In 1971 Der Lachs was taken over by the Hardenberg-Wilthen distillery and production was moved to the town of N\u00f6rten-Hardenberg in West Germany.\n\nIt is possible to buy the original brand of Goldwasser in the old town of Gdansk. The original Goldwasser distillery building, though not operational, has been rebuilt as it was before the war, and is now home to the exclusive restaurant \"Pod \u0141ososiem\" (The Salmon).\nVarious Polish brands from Gda\u0144sk sell similar drinks called Gda\u0144ska Z\u0142ot\u00f3wka (Gda\u0144sk gold) or Z\u0142ota Woda (Gold water).\nW\u00f3dka Gda\u0144ska is mentioned by the Polish-Lithuanian poet, Adam Mickiewicz, as a drink popular with the Polish nobility.\nLegend has it that when King of Poland Sigismund II Augustus visited Gda\u0144sk in 1549 after his coronation, part of the city's homage to the monarch was a gift of Goldwasser, and he is said to have sung the praises of the golden drink often along the rest of his tour.\nAnother brand of Goldwasser, Schwabacher Goldwasser, and other sorts of food embellished with gold, are produced in the city of Schwabach near Nuremberg. Goldschl\u00e4ger is a Swiss cinnamon schnapps which also contains small flakes of 22 karat gold.\nGoldwasser is used to flavour a traditional Souffl\u00e9 Rothschild.",

The product was launched in 1986 in the European market and in 1994 worldwide, and has been a nationally best-selling liqueur in several national markets, including Puerto Rico, the Netherlands and Belgium.\nThe liqueur, in the form of a red liquid, comes in a black bottle and has an  alcohol volume of 14.9 to 20% - depending on the country. The original version of Passo\u00e3 contains passion-fruit juice from Brazil. Passo\u00e3 has also developed ready-to-serve cocktails: Cosmopolitan, Caipirinha and Zombie fire.\nThe most popular cocktail made with Passo\u00e3 is the Porn Star Martini, with vanilla vodka and prosecco on the side. One can also pair Passo\u00e3 with water or with tonic.\nThe name \"Passo\u00e3\" is an instance of foreign branding; though it uses the Portuguese character \u00e3, there is no such word in the language. The Portuguese word for passion fruit is maracuj\u00e1, while the word for \"passion\" is paix\u00e3o.",

A variant type is prepared with concentrated liquid coffee or instant coffee powder. However, most references to the ponche crema name aim at a traditional commercial product, available since 1900, whose recipe and manufacturing process are kept secret. Ponche crema is a beverage traditionally served during Christmas time, much as eggnog is in the United States. It is usually served cold, in small cups, either as an aperitif or a pousse-caf\u00e9.\nThe origin of the recipe for this commercial product could not be determined.",

The word rompope is a derivation of the word rompon, which is used to describe the Spanish version of eggnog that came to Mexico. The Spanish version utilizes rum as its main ingredient, hence the root of both rom-pon and rom-pope, but in Central America, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, there is also a similar beverage known as rompopo. For example, Salcaja, in Guatemala, offers one known version of this rompope drink and in South America, the country of Chile has among its most popular drinks rompon and cola de mono or monkey's tail, the latter containing coffee, making it dark instead of yellow, but also containing the other ingredients commonly found in rompope.",

        "summary": "Vi\u0219inat\u0103  (Romanian pronunciation: [vi\u0283i\u02c8nat\u0259]) is a Romanian alcoholic beverage produced from sour cherries (vi\u0219ine in Romanian), sugar and alcohol. It is very flavorful and sweet, and most often home-made. As a consequence, there is no \"official\" recipe for it. Everybody tunes quantities and preparation methods to suit their own taste.Vi\u0219inat\u0103 is easy to make and is completely natural depending on the type of alcohol used. It is traditionally produced in small quantities, to suit a family's need.The jar is filled halfway with sour cherries and an equal amount of sugar (by weight, not volume). The mix may be left to ferment for a few days, then the rest of the jar filled with \u021buica or vodka (which stops the fermentation process) and sealed. The jar is then left in a dark place at room temperature for about 100 days. Contents are rolled around occasionally during this period to encourage proper mixing, especially during fermentation. At the end, the cherries are filtered out, and the resulting sweet drink is the \"vi\u0219inata\".\nThe flavor is heavily dependent on the quality of the fruit.  Therefore, it is advisable to use only hand-picked, healthy, well ripened, fresh fruit, if possible organically grown, and avoid getting leaves, stems, or other debris into the jar. The maceration in alcohol will amplify any bad taste in the fruit, such as with fruit that started to rot, instead of hiding it. Wood or leaves will release an unpleasant tannin into the drink, which will soften with age.\nAlternately, honey may be used instead of sugar. Few people do, however, since honey is more expensive, and depending on its type may not contribute in a positive way to the taste.Some production methods involve the smashing of the sour cherries before putting them in the jar. Alternatively, the kernels can be removed and broken open before being added to the jar. The inner, soft part of the kernel adds an almond-like flavor to the drink. These processes add the risk that the resulting drink will not be clear, as filtering is more difficult.\nMany people in Romania use single or double-distilled plum brandy (also homemade), which is not allowed to age instead of alimentary alcohol.\nAging the drink improves its taste - depending on the type of alcohol used, the initial drink may feel a little rough and burning. This rough sensation can be likened to that experienced whilst consuming carbonated drinks, hence \"vi\u0219inata\" is sometimes referred to by other cultures as \"fizzy wine\". \nThe remaining sour cherries are an excellent ingredient for cakes and pies, if used soon after removal from the jar - they get wrinkled and lose flavour with time.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==",

It is used in numerous Bond films thereafter with the notable exceptions of You Only Live Twice (1967), in which the drink is wrongly offered as \"stirred, not shaken\", to Bond's response \"Perfect\", and Casino Royale (2006) in which Bond, after losing millions of dollars in a game of poker, is asked if he wants his martini shaken or stirred and snaps, \"Do I look like I give a damn?\"",

Makers harvest the sap from birch trees once a year, from March to April. Tree damage from sap collection to make this drink led to a licensing system for the collection of sap, introduced in 2008.Birch water is used medicinally, externally and internally.\nThe sap contains many components including: sugars, fruit acids, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, manganese, zinc, sodium, and iron. Unique elements include saponin, a nutrient that may help block cholesterol absorption.\nBirch tree water is a traditional beverage in Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, and other parts of Northern Europe, and in parts of Northern China.Entire research institutes were devoted to researching the benefits of this tree in the former Soviet Union. The birch tree water industry collapsed along with the demise of the USSR, and large scale production has only recently restarted.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "summary": "Camel milk is milk from female camels.  It has supported nomad and pastoral cultures since the domestication of camels millennia ago. Herders may for periods survive solely on the milk when taking the camels on long distances to graze in desert and arid environments, especially in parts of the Middle East, North Africa and the Horn of Africa. The camel dairy farming industry has grown in Australia and the United States, as an environmentally friendly alternative to cow dairy farming using a species well-adapted to arid regions.\nCamel milk has different nutritional characteristics from cow milk, but the proportions of nutrients can be highly variable based on a number of factors, including type and age of camel, climate, what it eats, and milking method. It can be used to make products such as yogurt and ice cream, but is not so easily turned into butter or cheese.",

        "summary": "Fermentation is a metabolic process that produces chemical changes in organic substances through the action of enzymes. In biochemistry, it is broadly defined as the extraction of energy from carbohydrates in the absence of oxygen. In food production, it may more broadly refer to any process in which the activity of microorganisms brings about a desirable change to a foodstuff or beverage. The science of fermentation is known as zymology.\nIn microorganisms, fermentation is the primary means of producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by the degradation of organic nutrients anaerobically.\nHumans have used fermentation to produce foodstuffs and beverages since the Neolithic age. For example, fermentation is used for preservation in a process that produces lactic acid found in such sour foods as pickled cucumbers, kombucha, kimchi, and yogurt, as well as for producing alcoholic beverages such as wine and beer. Fermentation also occurs within the gastrointestinal tracts of all animals, including humans.Industrial fermentation is a broader term used for the process of applying microbes for the large-scale production of chemicals, biofuels, enzymes, proteins and pharmaceuticals.",

        "summary": "The Glencairn whisky glass is a style of glass intended for drinking whisky, developed and produced by Glencairn Crystal Ltd, in East Kilbride, a town near Glasgow, Scotland since 1981; originally designed by Raymond Davidson, managing director of the company. The shape of the glass is derived from the traditional nosing copitas used in whisky labs around Scotland. The glass design was concluded with the aid of master blenders from five of the largest whisky companies in Scotland. The glass first came into production in 2001. Since then, additional mini-Glencairns and Canadian Glencairns were introduced.\nThe original Glencairn glass is approximately 115 mm (4+1\u20442 in) in height and has been available in three variations: 24% lead crystal, lead-free crystal, and soda-lime glass. The vast majority of glasses in circulation are of the lead-free crystal variety. The soda-lime variation was discontinued in 2008. Mini Glencairns look the same as regular Glencairns but are smaller and used at distilleries for serving samples. Canadian Glencairns are the largest of the three, and were made for Canadian whiskey that is usually served on the rocks (with ice). Therefore, the Canadian Glencairn has a wider bowl and has a 350 ml (11+3\u20444 US fl oz) capacity.\nThe capacity of a typical Glencairn whisky glass is approximately 175 ml (6 US fl oz), and it is intended to hold approximately 50 ml (1.7 US fl oz) of liquid.In 2006 the glass won the Queen's Award for innovation.The Glencairn glass is not the only glass on the market that is designed specifically for drinking whisky. (For example, Riedel and Norlan Glass also manufacture such glassware.) While there are numerous styles of such glasses available, the Glencairn is the first style to be endorsed by the Scotch Whisky Association, and to be used by every whisky company in Scotland and Ireland.Old fashioned tumblers, snifters, and nosing copitas are other types of glasses that are commonly used for drinking whisky. The traditional style of whisky glass is a cut glass crystal (also known as an \"old fashioned glass\", \"rocks glass\" or \"lowball glass\" in the United States), an iconic design that remains the most commonly used type of whisky glass. However, a tumbler does not hold and focus the aromas as much for the experience of the drinker as the other styles, which curve inwards towards the top of the glass. While not all drinkers may find the strong aroma produced by such glasses desirable, inward-curved glasses are often preferred by connoisseurs who consider the aroma especially important to the experience of a whiskey...\n\n thank you---",

        "summary": "Guinness () is an Irish dry stout that originated in the brewery of Arthur Guinness at St. James's Gate, Dublin, Ireland, in 1759. It is now owned by the British-based multinational alcoholic beverage maker Diageo. It is one of the most successful alcohol brands worldwide, brewed in almost 50 countries, and available in over 120. Sales in 2011 amounted to 850,000,000 litres (190,000,000 imp gal; 220,000,000 U.S. gal). In spite of declining consumption since 2001, it is the best-selling alcoholic drink in Ireland where Guinness & Co. Brewery makes almost \u20ac2 billion worth of beer annually.\nThe Guinness Storehouse is a tourist attraction at St. James's Gate Brewery in Dublin, Ireland. Since opening in 2000, it has received over 20 million visitors.\nGuinness's flavour derives from malted barley and roasted unmalted barley, a relatively modern development, not becoming part of the grist until the mid-20th century. For many years, a portion of aged brew was blended with freshly brewed beer to give a sharp lactic acid flavour. Although Guinness's palate still features a characteristic \"tang\", the company has refused to confirm whether this type of blending still occurs. The draught beer's thick, creamy head comes from mixing the beer with nitrogen and carbon dioxide.The company moved its headquarters to London at the beginning of the Anglo-Irish trade war in 1932. In 1997, Guinness plc merged with Grand Metropolitan to form the multinational alcoholic-drinks producer Diageo plc, based in London.",

        "summary": "Kompot or compot, as used in as prepared in Central and Eastern Europe and West Asia, refers to boiled fruits (either fresh or dried), served either as a drink or as desert (stewed fruit) depending on the region in question.  When served as stewed fruits, it is essentially identical with the French compote, which is the origin of the term.  When served as a drink, it is also known as \u0432\u0437\u0432\u0430\u0440 vzvar or \u0443\u0437\u0432\u0430\u0440 uzvar  from the Slavic root word meaning \"to boil\".\nAs a drink it is a non-alcoholic sweet beverage that may be served hot or cold, depending on tradition and season. It is obtained by cooking fruit such as strawberries, apricots, peaches, apples, raspberries, rhubarb, plums, or sour cherries in a large volume of water, often together with sugar or raisins as additional sweeteners. Sometimes different spices such as vanilla or cinnamon are added for additional flavour, especially in winter when kompot is usually served hot. Kompot is popular in Central and Eastern European countries as well as in Southern Europe.\nKompot is part of the culinary cultures of many countries in Central, Eastern, Southern Europe and Middle East, such as Bulgaria, Armenia, Albania, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, North Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Moldova and Romania, Kosovo, the Czech Republic, Greece, Georgia, Cyprus and Turkey. Kompot (Polish, Czech, Slovenian, Azerbaijani, Uzbek, Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, Macedonian; \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043e\u0442 in: Russian, Ukrainian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, Bosnian; Komp\u00f3t in: Slovak, Hungarian; Kompott in: German, Estonian; Kompotas in: Lithuanian; Kompots in: Latvian; \u043a\u0430\u043c\u043f\u043e\u0442 in: Belarusian; \u056f\u0578\u0574\u057a\u0578\u057f in: Armenian; \u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 in: Greek; \u10d9\u10dd\u10db\u10de\u10dd\u10e2\u10d8 in: Georgian; Compot in: Romanian; Komposto in: Albanian and Turkish) was a widely used way of preserving fruit for the winter season in Southern and Eastern European countries. In 1885, Lucyna \u0106wierczakiewiczowa wrote in a recipe book that kompot preserved fruit so well it seemed fresh. Kompot was still popular in the 1970s. It is also popular in many Central Asian countries, such as Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.In the colder parts of Europe, instead of stewing the fruits and then preserving the result, fruits are instead dried, and then re-hydrated to make kompot / uzvar.  This method is notably used in the Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper prepared in the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth lands.\nThe consumption of kompot has been declining since the 1980s. With the end of food preservation in many countries of South and Eastern Europe, kompot has been supplanted by fruit juice, soft drinks and mineral water.",

It was common in many religions of antiquity and continues to be offered in cultures today.\nVarious substances have been used for libations, most commonly wine or other alcoholic drinks, olive oil, honey, and in India, ghee. The vessels used in the ritual, including the patera, often had a significant form which differentiated them from secular vessels. The libation could be poured onto something of religious significance, such as an altar, or into the earth.\nIn East Asia, pouring an offering of rice into a running stream symbolizes the detachment from karma and bad energy.",

It is made with sugar and the bark and/or fruit of certain species in the genus Colubrina including Colubrina elliptica (also called behuco indio) and Colubrina arborescens, a small tree native to the northern Caribbean and south Florida. Recipes usually include other ingredients as well, spices such as aniseed being very common. Mauby was traditionally a fermented beverage made in small batches, but is now predominantly a commercial non-fermented soft drink.\n\nHaiti and the Dominican Republic are two of the largest Caribbean exporters of the bark and leaves. Often the drink is fermented using a portion of the previous batch, while sometimes it is consumed unfermented. Mauby is often bought as a pre-made syrup and then mixed with water (sparkling or still) to the consumer's taste, but many make it themselves at home or purchase it from neighbourhood producers or street sellers. Its taste is initially sweet, somewhat like root beer, but changes to a prolonged, but not astringent bitter aftertaste. To many, it is an acquired taste, and has been known to cause an initial laxative reaction unexpected to many first-time drinkers.\nIn Puerto Rico the drink is also called mavi champ\u00e1n (champagne mauby) this is because the drink is fermented causing it to foam. This process is made by mixing an older batch with a new batch. Mauby bark and leaves are boiled with ginger, avocado leaves, brown sugar and other spices. The drink is then places in a tight sealed bottle and left out in the sun for 6-8 hours. The drink is then placed in a dark cool place left to ferment up to a week. Ginger has a significant role in the fermentation process.",

Naqe'e Al Zabib is served fresh, and as the name implies (zab\u012bb means \"raisins\") it is made of grapes. It is similar to nabidh, an infusion that is made mildly alcoholic from the fermentation of sugars and was consumed widely in the pre-Islamic age. As alcohol (khamr) is considered haram in Islam, both nabidh and naqe'e al zabib are fermented for a certain time before it is converted to alcohol.\nRaisins have high levels of vitamin C and other anti-oxidants, are important sources of phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron and copper, and help to prevent tooth decay. To prepare the infusion the raisins are thoroughly washed, covered in hot water, and then left to soak for three hours before being pressed through a sieve to extract the juice. Other recipes recommend boiling the raisins and/or soaking the raisins in the refrigerator overnight before squeezing out the juice. Sometimes the raisins are boiled a second time after the overnight soaking.\n\n\n== References ==",

The name comes from \"Pommery\", referring to Champagne, and Cognac, as it is matured in oak barrels like wine. Another theory of the naming is the French word pomace, which literally means remains of pressed fruits. See also Ripasso.\nThe recipe is kept a secret.\nIn 1919, after his best efforts to keep his brewery running Anders Lindahl moved to Stockholm, Sweden as a failed businessman, and founded Fructus Fabriker and began to make Pommac. The recipe was made by a Finland-Swedish inventor. The drink was made for the upper classes as an alcohol-free substitute for wine.\nIn the US, Dr Pepper distributed a formulation of it, with sodium cyclamate as a sweetener, as a diet drink from 1963 to 1969 in six-and-a-half- and ten-ounce bottles. The original had always used sugar as its sweetener.\nPommac is also served as a non-alcoholic champagne alternative on festive occasions. \nIn late 2004, Carlsberg in Denmark announced that they were going to cease production of Pommac for financial reasons. However, after overwhelming public demand, the company decided to keep marketing Pommac.\nFinnish brewery Hartwall has produced Pommac in Finland since 1950. It purchased the Finnish trademark in 2001. Pommac is in Finland an extremely popular non-alcoholic substitute for champagne and sparkling wines, and as children's birthday celebration drink.",

For the Newars, aila is indispensable during festivals and various religious rituals as libation, prasad or sagan.\nIn CNN's list of the world's 50 most delicious drinks, raksi was ranked 41st and was described as follows: \"made from millet or rice, raksi is strong on the nose and sends a burning sensation straight down your throat that resolves itself into a surprisingly smooth, velvety sensation. Nepalese drink this home brew to celebrate festivals, though some think that the prized drink itself is the reason to celebrate.\"Because of its popularity, various temperance movements exist in Nepal, including various women's groups. Raksi, however, remains an important requirement of various religious rituals and social events, due in part perhaps to its antiseptic properties.\nGC-MS based metabolomics revealed medicinal compounds present in raksi collected from high altitudes of Singalila Ridge of the Himalayas. Study claims raksi contains compounds which are useful as a remedy of high altitudes sickness.",

        "summary": "Koskenkorva Viina (also known simply as Koskenkorva or Kossu) is a traditional clear spirit drink (38%) in Finland, produced by Anora Group at the Koskenkorva distillery in Ilmajoki and bottled in Rajam\u00e4ki, Nurmij\u00e4rvi.The grain (barley) alcohol is produced using 200-step continuous distillation designed to produce high-purity industrial ethanol. The drink is produced by diluting this alcohol with spring water and a very small amount of sugar. Although commonly called a vodka in English, in Finland it is not called a \"vodka\", but viina (see br\u00e4nnvin), although the word \"vodka\" is found in the label due to EU regulations. Koskenkorva Vodka is the same beverage (but with 40% or 60% alcohol instead of the traditional 38%) intended for foreign markets.\nBesides the standard 38% near-unflavored there are several variants of Koskenkorva on the market, most notably the famous Salmiakki Koskenkorva, better known as Salmiakkikossu or Salmari, which is salmiakki-flavored. Another variant is the same Koskenkorva with rye instead of barley, marketed under the same concept as Koskenkorva Viina Ruis. There also exists a vanilla variant called Vanilja Koskenkorva.  Finlandia Vodka, a vodka classified as \"imported premium\", is the same as Koskenkorva 40%, except that sugar is not added. Altia sold this brand, intended for foreign markets, to the American Brown-Forman Corporation, but remains the sole producer of Finlandia Vodka at least until 2017.\nKoskenkorva is typically enjoyed cold, but can be also mixed with cola (commonly referred to as Kossukola), carbonated water (Kossuvissy), orange juice (\"screwdriver\"), energy drink, or certain (hard) salty liquorice candies. The latter is often made by mixing ground tyrkisk peber candies with the drink, though other similar candies are also used, and there exists a premade salmiakki mixer for this particular purpose. A similar way of enjoying kossu is by mixing ground Fisherman's Friend lozenges to the drink; the resulting cocktail is known as \"Fisu\" (Helsinki slang for \"fish\").",

The drink won gold medals in liquor competitions in Madrid, Spain in 1982 and 1983, and again in Barcelona in 2006. The medals are featured prominently on the product's packaging and have led to it being referred to locally as \"SangSom Rianthong\" (SangSom Gold Medallion).The beverage is virtually unheard of outside Thailand. The manufacturers, SangSom Company, export to around 20 countries, but export sales account for barely one percent of total sales.

        "summary": "Alcohol intoxication, also known in overdose as alcohol poisoning, commonly described as drunkenness or inebriation, is the behavior and physical effects caused by a recent consumption of alcohol. In addition to the toxicity of ethanol, the main psychoactive component of alcoholic beverages, other physiological symptoms may arise from the activity of acetaldehyde, a metabolite of alcohol. These effects may not arise until hours after ingestion and may contribute to the condition colloquially known as a hangover.\nSymptoms of intoxication at lower doses may include mild sedation and poor coordination. At higher doses, there may be slurred speech, trouble walking, and vomiting. Extreme doses may result in a respiratory depression, coma, or death. Complications may include seizures, aspiration pneumonia, low blood sugar, and injuries or self-harm such as suicide. Alcohol intoxication can lead to alcohol-related crime with perpetrators more likely to be intoxicated than victims.Alcohol intoxication typically begins after two or more alcoholic drinks. Alcohol has the potential for abuse.  Risk factors include a social situation where heavy drinking is common and a person having an impulsive personality. Diagnosis is usually based on the history of events and physical examination. Verification of events by witnesses may be useful. Legally, alcohol intoxication is often defined as a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of greater than 5.4\u201317.4 mmol/L (25\u201380 mg/dL or 0.025\u20130.080%). This can be measured by blood or breath testing. Alcohol is broken down in the human body at a rate of about 3.3 mmol/L (15 mg/dL) per hour, depending on an individual's metabolic rate (metabolism).Management of alcohol intoxication involves supportive care. Typically this includes putting the person in the recovery position, keeping the person warm, and making sure breathing is sufficient. Gastric lavage and activated charcoal have not been found to be useful. Repeated assessments may be required to rule out other potential causes of a person's symptoms.Acute intoxication has been documented throughout history, and alcohol remains one of the world's most widespread recreational drugs. Some religions consider alcohol intoxication to be a sin.",

        "summary": "Alcoholism is the continued drinking of alcohol despite negative results. Problematic use of alcohol has been mentioned in the earliest historical records, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated there were 283 million people with alcohol use disorders worldwide as of 2016. The term alcoholism was first coined in 1852, but alcoholism and alcoholic are stigmatizing and discourage seeking treatment, so clinical diagnostic terms such as alcohol use disorder or alcohol dependence are used instead.Alcohol is addictive, and heavy long-term alcohol use results in many negative health and social consequences. It can damage all the organ systems, but especially affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas and immune system. Heavy alcohol usage can result in trouble sleeping, and severe cognitive issues like dementia, brain damage, or Wernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome. Physical effects include irregular heartbeat, an impaired immune response, liver cirrhosis, increased cancer risk, and severe withdrawal symptoms if stopped suddenly. These health effects can reduce life expectancy by 10 years. Drinking during pregnancy may harm the child's health, and drunk driving increases the risk of traffic accidents. Alcoholism is also associated with increases in violent and non-violent crime. While alcoholism directly resulted in 139,000 deaths worldwide in 2013, in 2012 3.3 million deaths may be attributable globally to alcohol.The development of alcoholism is attributed to both environment and genetics equally. The use of alcohol to self-medicate stress or anxiety can turn into alcoholism. Someone with a parent or sibling with an alcohol use disorder is three to four times more likely to develop an alcohol use disorder themselves, but only a minority of them do. Environmental factors include social, cultural and behavioral influences. High stress levels and anxiety, as well as alcohol's inexpensive cost and easy accessibility, increase the risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. After a person stops drinking alcohol, they may experience a low level of withdrawal lasting for months. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Questionnaires are usually used to detect possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.Treatment of alcoholism may take several forms. Due to medical problems that can occur during withdrawal, alcohol cessation should be controlled carefully. One common method involves the use of benzodiazepine medications, such as diazepam. These can be taken while admitted to a health care institution or individually. The medications acamprosate or disulfiram may also be used to help prevent further drinking. Mental illness or other addictions may complicate treatment. Various individual or group therapy or support groups are used to attempt to keep a person from returning to alcoholism. Among them is the abstinence based mutual aid fellowship Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). A 2020 scientific review found that clinical interventions encouraging increased participation in AA (AA/twelve step facilitation (AA/TSF))\u2014resulted in higher abstinence rates over other clinical interventions, and most studies in the review found that AA/TSF led to lower health costs.Many terms, some slurs and some informal, have been used to refer to people affected by alcoholism such as tippler, drunkard, dipsomaniac and souse.",

        "summary": "Amanita muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is a basidiomycete of the genus Amanita. It is a large white-gilled, white-spotted, and usually red mushroom.\nDespite its easily distinguishable features, A. muscaria is a fungus with several known variations, or subspecies. These subspecies are slightly different, some having yellow or white caps, but are all usually called fly agarics, most often recognizable by their notable white spots. Recent DNA fungi research, however, has shown that some mushrooms called 'fly agaric' are in fact unique species, such as A. persicina (the peach-colored fly agaric).\nNative throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, A. muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations, and is now a true cosmopolitan species. It associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees.\nAlthough poisonous, death due to poisoning from A. muscaria ingestion is quite rare. Parboiling twice with water draining weakens its toxicity and breaks down the mushroom's psychoactive substances; it is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. All A. muscaria varieties, but in particular A. muscaria var. muscaria, are noted for their hallucinogenic properties, with the main psychoactive constituents being muscimol and its neurotoxic precursor ibotenic acid. A local variety of the mushroom was used as an intoxicant and entheogen by the indigenous peoples of Siberia.Arguably the most iconic toadstool species, the fly agaric is one of the most recognizable and widely encountered in popular culture, including in video games\u2014for example, the frequent use of a recognizable A. muscaria in the Mario franchise (e.g. its Super Mushroom power-up)\u2014and television\u2014for example, the houses in The Smurfs franchise. There have been cases of children admitted to hospitals after consuming this poisonous mushroom; the children may have been attracted to it because of its pop-culture associations.",

        "summary": "Binge drinking, or heavy episodic drinking, is drinking alcoholic beverages with an intention of becoming intoxicated by heavy consumption of alcohol over a short period of time, but definitions (see below) vary considerably.Binge drinking is a style of drinking that is popular in several countries worldwide, and overlaps somewhat with social drinking since it is often done in groups. The degree of intoxication however, varies between and within various cultures that engage in this practice. A binge on alcohol can occur over hours, last up to several days, or in the event of extended abuse, even weeks. Due to the long term effects of alcohol abuse, binge drinking is considered to be a major public health issue.Binge drinking is more common in males, during adolescence and young adulthood. Heavy regular binge drinking is associated with adverse effects on neurologic, cardiac, gastrointestinal, hematologic, immune, and musculoskeletal organ systems as well as increasing the risk of alcohol induced psychiatric disorders. A US-based review of the literature found that up to one-third of adolescents binge-drink, with 6% reaching the threshold of having an alcohol-related substance use disorder. Approximately one in 25 women binge-drinks during pregnancy, which can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Binge drinking during adolescence is associated with traffic accidents and other types of accidents, violent behavior as well as suicide. The more often a child or adolescent binge drinks and the younger they are the more likely that they will develop an alcohol use disorder including alcoholism. A large number of adolescents who binge-drink also consume other psychotropic substances.Frequent binge drinking can lead to brain damage faster and more severe than chronic drinking (alcoholism). The neurotoxic insults are due to very large amounts of glutamate which are released and overstimulate the brain as a binge finishes. This results in excitotoxicity, a process which damages or kills neurons (brain cells). Each binge drinking episode immediately insults the brain; repeat episodes result in accumulating harm. The developing adolescent brain is thought to be particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of binge drinking, with some evidence of brain damage occurring from drinking more than 10 or 11 drinks once or twice per month. A 2020 study found that even a single episode of binge drinking can lead to atrophy of the brain's corpus callosum, from which damage was still detectable by an MRI scanner five weeks later. With prolonged abstinence neurogenesis occurs which can potentially reverse the damage from alcohol abuse.",

A common formulation included \"a variable amount of morphine, 10 mg of cocaine, 2.5 mL of 98% ethyl alcohol, 5 mL of syrup BP and a variable amount of chloroform water.\"  Brompton's cocktail was given most in the mid twentieth century. It is now considered obsolete.In popular culture it also came to be associated with medical euthanasia.

        "summary": "Ephedra is a medicinal preparation from the plant Ephedra sinica.  Several additional species belonging to the genus Ephedra have traditionally been used for a variety of medicinal purposes, and are a possible candidate for the soma plant of Indo-Iranian religion. It has been used in traditional Chinese medicine, in which it is referred to as Ma Huang, for more than 2,000 years. Native Americans and Mormon pioneers drank a tea brewed from other Ephedra species, called \"Mormon tea\" and \"Indian tea\".\n\nDietary supplements containing ephedra alkaloids have been found to be unsafe, with reports of serious side effects and ephedra-related deaths. In response to accumulating evidence of adverse effects and deaths related to ephedra, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the sale of supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in 2004. The ban was challenged in court by ephedra manufacturers, but ultimately upheld in 2006 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Ephedra extracts not containing ephedrine have not been banned by the FDA and are still sold legally.",

        "summary": "A hangover is the experience of various unpleasant physiological and psychological effects usually following the consumption of alcohol, such as wine, beer, and liquor. Hangovers can last for several hours or for more than 24 hours. Typical symptoms of a hangover may include headache, drowsiness, concentration problems, dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal distress (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), absence of hunger, light sensitivity, depression, sweating, hyper-excitability, irritability, and anxiety.While the causes of a hangover are still poorly understood, several factors are known to be involved including acetaldehyde accumulation, changes in the immune system and glucose metabolism, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, disturbed prostaglandin synthesis, increased cardiac output, vasodilation, sleep deprivation, and malnutrition. Beverage-specific effects of additives or by-products such as congeners in alcoholic beverages also play an important role. The symptoms usually occur after the intoxicating effect of the alcohol begins to wear off, generally the morning after a night of heavy drinking.Though many possible remedies and folk cures have been suggested, there is no compelling evidence to suggest that any are effective for preventing or treating hangovers. Avoiding alcohol or drinking in moderation are the most effective ways to avoid a hangover.\nThe socioeconomic consequences of hangovers include workplace absenteeism, impaired job performance, reduced productivity and poor academic achievement. A hangover may also impair performance during potentially dangerous daily activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery.",

        "summary": "A nightclub is a club that is open at night, usually for drinking, dancing and other entertainment. Nightclubs often have a bar and discoth\u00e8que (usually simply known as disco) with a dance floor, laser lighting displays, and a stage for live music or a disc jockey (DJ) who mixes recorded music. Nightclubs tend to be smaller than live music venues like theatres and stadiums, with few or no seats for customers.\nNightclubs generally restrict access to people in terms of age, attire, personal belongings, and inappropriate behaviors. Nightclubs typically have dress codes to prohibit people wearing informal, indecent, offensive, or gang-related attire from entering. Unlike other entertainment venues, nightclubs are more likely to use bouncers to screen prospective patrons for entry.\nThe busiest nights for a nightclub are Friday and Saturday nights. Most nightclubs cater to a particular music genre or sound for branding effects. Some nightclubs may offer food and beverages (including alcoholic beverages).",

Its common English-language name came about because of a resemblance to rue (to which it is not related). Because eating it would sicken or kill livestock, it is considered a noxious weed in a number of countries. It has become an invasive species in some regions of the western United States. The plant is popular in Middle Eastern and north African folk medicine. The alkaloids contained in the plant, including the seeds, are monoamine oxidase inhibitors (Harmine, Harmaline).",

The word was added to the New Oxford American Dictionary in 2005, although it was used as early as 1978. It is a portmanteau of smoking and speakeasy. As smoking bans have become generally accepted, the term has fallen into disuse.\nHigh levels of compliance with smoke-free laws have been reported in most jurisdictions including New York, Ireland, Italy and Scotland.

        "summary": "A tailgate party is a social event held on and around the open tailgate of a vehicle. Tailgating, which primarily takes place in the United States and Canada, often involves consuming alcoholic beverages while barbecuing and grilling food. Tailgate parties occur in the parking lots at stadiums and arenas, before and occasionally after games, festivals, and concerts. People attending such a party are said to be 'tailgating'. Many people participate even if their vehicles do not have tailgates. Tailgate parties also involve people bringing their own alcoholic beverages, barbecues, and food, which are sampled and shared among fans attending the tailgate. Tailgates are intended to be non-commercial events, so selling items to the fans is frowned upon and can even be considered illegal soliciting. Tailgating is often seen as a critical part of the sports experience in the United States. Because many American sports venues are surrounded by large parking lots, tailgating often takes place right outside stadium and arena entrances.\nTailgate parties have spread to the pre-game festivities at sporting events besides American and Canadian football, such as basketball, hockey, baseball and  soccer. They also occur at non-sporting events such as weddings, cultural festivals and concerts. As American and Canadian football outside North America has copied many of its associated traditions from the National Football League (NFL), the Canadian Football League (CFL), and college football, tailgating parties are also held at some American football games in Europe.",

While many wine bars are private \"stand-alone\" establishments, in some cases, wine bars are associated with a specific wine retailer or other outlet of wine, to provide additional marketing for that retailer's wine portfolio. In countries where licensing regulations allow this, some wine bars also sell the wines they serve, and effectively function as a hybrid between a wine shop and a wine bar.",

        "summary": "Lamb's Navy Rum is a sugar-cane based Caribbean rum popular in the UK and Canada.\nIn 1849, 22-year-old Londoner Alfred Lamb, son of wine and spirits merchant William Lamb, blended 18 different rums from Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad to produce Lamb's Navy Rum. His company took the name Alfred Lamb & Son.The use of the term \"navy rum\" dates back to the Royal Navy issuing a daily ration of rum to its sailors. It had previously given its sailors French brandy, but the 1655 conquest of Jamaica gave it access to rum, which it quickly exploited. Lamb's was never an official supplier to the Royal Navy. The 1970 decision of the British Royal Navy to end issuing daily rum rations to its sailors inspired the brand that year to adopt the advertising campaign, \"Join the Lamb\u2019s Navy.\"\nAlfred Lamb & Son was bombed out of its London premises on Great Tower Street in World War II. Its competitor, White Keeling Rum Merchants, was bombed out of its premises, too. Portal, Dingwall & Norris took them both into its premises at 40 Eastcheap, London, inspiring the three companies to merge in 1946 to form United Rum Merchants.In 1952, Canadian company Corby Distilleries signed an agreement with United Rum Merchants to bottle the brand under licence in Canada.\nLamb's became part of the Allied Lyons portfolio in 1984, which itself was acquired (as Allied Domecq) in 2005 by French drinks giant Pernod Ricard. As part of the deal, Pernod Ricard had to sell off some brands, and Lamb's was acquired by Corby, which became an affiliate of Pernod Ricard by virtue of the Allied Domecq purchase.Corby Distilleries bottles Lamb's in Canada for the North American markets. Outside North America, it is also bottled by Halewood International in England, which distributes it in Europe, Africa and Asia.In 2009, Halewood International launched a spiced version aimed at international markets. This failed to meet sales expectations, so it was reformulated in 2014.\n\n\n== References ==",

In addition to bottling Pepsi products, the company produced Grapico in 1916, a grape-flavored soft drink, and a ginger ale under its own brand name.\nBuffalo Rock ginger ale is considerably darker in color and has a stronger ginger content than is customary.  Some customers use the term \"ginger cola\" to describe the taste.  Buffalo Rock and Grapico are sold throughout Alabama, parts of Georgia and the panhandle of Florida.\n\nIn 2005, Buffalo Rock introduced a soft drink called Dr. Wham. Dr. Wham is sold in Buffalo Rock markets where the company does not have the territorial rights to sell Dr Pepper, including markets such as Huntsville, Alabama, Montgomery, Alabama, Columbus, Georgia, Pensacola, Florida, and Staunton, Virginia. A complete listing of markets that carry Dr. Wham is on the Buffalo Rock website.",

        "summary": "Double Seven was an Indian soft drink brand. It was manufactured and marketed by the Indian government after Coca-Cola quit the Indian market in 1977 due to changes in government policies. Double Seven was launched at the annual trade fair at Pragati Maidan, New Delhi as a gift by the then ruling Janata Party.In 1977, as per the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act brought by the Morarji Desai government, Coca-Cola was required to reduce its ownership stake of its Indian operation. Coca-Cola along with other United States companies chose to leave India than to operate under the new laws.Developed to fill the void left by Coca-Cola, Double Seven was quickly designed, named by a national competition for naming the product, manufactured and marketed by Modern Food Industries, a government-owned company. The formula for the concentrate of Double Seven was developed at Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore. Despite government backing, Double Seven could not dominate the Indian soft drinks market, however the program was very successful as the void left by Coca-Cola was filled. The main competitors to Double Seven were Campa Cola, Thums Up, Duke's, McDowell's Crush and Double Cola. Double Seven also had a lemon-lime soft drink known as Double Seven Tingle.Double Seven was the winning name in a national competition to name the drink. The drink lost share of market as Indira Gandhi's government that came to power a few years later was not interested in supporting a product which reminded them of 1977, the year that Indira Gandhi lost the national elections and other drinks like Thums Up became very popular. Modern Food Industries gradually slipped into the red and was taken over by Hindustan Lever Limited in January 2000.Thums Up, which was also launched in 1977 after the departure of Coca-Cola, continued to thrive until its eventual takeover by Coca-Cola.",

The original Fassbrause also includes spices and is a speciality of Berlin, where it is sometimes called Sportmolle. (Molle used to be a term for \"beer\" in the Berlin dialect.)\nFassbrause is about the same color as some beers, and usually has an apple flavour. The taste is strongly reminiscent of the Austrian drink Almdudler, except that Fassbrause is less sweet, and not quite as spicy.\nA variant of Fassbrause, the so-called Rote Fassbrause (\"red keg soda\"), which is available in some of the new states, but not in Berlin itself, appeared in the 1950s. This variant was available in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) prior to German Reunification and has a raspberry flavour.\nAnother non-alcoholic variant has been produced in the United States since the 1960s under the name \"Apple Beer\".\nAs the term Fassbrause is not protected, completely altered variants with no direct link to the original Berlin recipe have been created and marketed starting in the 2010s. \nCologne brewery Gaffel Becker & Co was the first to start with Gaffel Fassbrause in April 2010, and many big breweries followed.\nSince then, the term Fassbrause has been perceived ambiguous in different ways in Western and Eastern Germany, because many people in Western Germany were not aware of the original specialty from Berlin.",

        "summary": "Grapico is a caffeine-free, artificially flavored carbonated soft drink with a purple color and a grape taste that is sold in the Southeastern United States. When introduced in 1916, the product quickly became a success, which in part was due to implying that Grapico contained real grape juice even though it contained fake juice. In the spring of 1926, J. Grossman's Sons sold the Grapico business to the Pan American Manufacturing Company in New Orleans. Pan American continued J. Grossman's Sons' improper practice of implying that Grapico contained real grape juice and lost the right to use the word \"Grapico\" to designate their artificial grape drink in 1929.\nAlthough the J. Grossman's Sons line of the brand had ended, the Grapico brand continued on through Alabama businessman R. R. Rochell and his Birmingham, Alabama-based Grapico Bottling Works. R. R. Rochell had first become a wholesale syrup customer of J. Grossman's Sons in the summer of 1917 to serve the Alabama soft drink market. By the time Pan American had lost their artificial grape drink name in 1929, Rochell was selling bottled Grapico in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and Louisiana.\nRochell received the federal trademark on Grapico in 1940, giving his Grapico Company of America the right to use the name \"Grapico\" everywhere in the United States. In 1955, Grapico Company of America attempted to expand its fruit-flavored brands with Orangico, a sister product to Grapico that included real orange juice. The orange juice-based Orangico did not sell well and the federal trademark eventually expired. In September 1981, both the franchising rights to the Grapico brand name and The Pepsi Bottling Group in Newnan, Georgia were acquired by Buffalo Rock, an independent Pepsi bottler based in Birmingham, Alabama. Buffalo Rock revived the Orangico trademark in 1999 for an artificially flavored orange drink and introduced Diet Grapico in 2005. Grapico is now produced at Buffalo Rock's Birmingham, Alabama bottling facility.",

Dansk Coladrink is an independent company owned by the stock holders; however, Brewery Vestfyen owns a majority of stock in the company. Up until the 1980s, Jolly Cola had a market share of about 40% of the Danish cola market. This was extraordinary, as Denmark is one of a few countries in the world, where another cola than the original Coca-Cola has had a larger market share. \nJolly Cola's longtime slogan \"Say Jolly to your cola!\" was changed to \"Free your taste\" on its 50th birthday in 2009.

It contains a kavalactone additive, kava consumption being traditionally important in western Pacific nations. Lava Cola has been described as an \"anti-energy drink\". Australian media have noted that it \"produces the calming effect of kava without the muddy taste,\" adding that, while kava itself is an acquired taste, Lava Cola may well be suitable for export.The cola began as a syrupy \"water-based kava extract\" developed by Australian-born James Armitage in 2009. He then successfully approached Vanuatu Beverage to suggest blending it with cola. The watery kava syrup is \"added to cola in a proportion of 15 millilitres to a bottle of 330 ml\". The drink is now produced in a factory on the outskirts of Port Vila, the country's capital. It went into production for the domestic market in October 2009. Lava Cola uses kava produced on the island of Maewo, which has generated an increase in revenues for local producers. Vanuatu Beverage hopes to export the drink first to Fiji and New Caledonia, then to a wider market.",

A diet version was also available, with the color scheme reversed.

Tim Richmond won that race. Commercials for the product featured comedian Tim Conway and actor Kevin Dobson as spokespersons.\nBecause several 7 Up bottlers also distributed colas such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola or eventual 7 Up sister drink RC Cola (which introduced another caffeine-free cola, RC 100, in 1980) they refused to distribute Like Cola \u2013 limiting its availability.The Like name was first used from 1963 to 1969 for 7 Up's diet lemon-lime soda which was renamed Diet 7 Up.",

It was created by two brothers, Ramon and Manuel Rodriguez Fonseca, who started Embotelladora El Sol after learning the trade from the father, a Spanish industrialist who arrived to Mexico in the 20th Century. The formula for Manzana Sol, a cider flavored drink, was registered in 1950, when the original factory was based in Mexico City's neighborhood of San Pedro de los Pinos, and later moved to Acoxpa 69, in Coapa. PepsiCo. bought the formula in the nineties. It originally included 6% of apple juice. \nIn the United States it is sold in 12-pack cans, 2-liter, and 20-ounce bottles.  The drink is known to be available at Walmart, Albertsons, H-E-B, Ralphs, Kmart, Food 4 Less, Jewel-Osco, Dominick's, Target, Vons, Stater Bros., United Supermarkets in the Amarillo and Lubbock, Texas area, and other smaller chains and smaller family run stores. In Latin American countries, Manzanita Sol competes with Coca-Cola's Manzana Lift. Manzanita Sol is PepsiCo's number two brand in Mexico, with apple being Mexico's second most popular soft drink flavor. It is also very popular in border regions such as the Los Angeles and El Paso metro areas.\nIn January 2014, Taco Bell added Manzanita Sol to their choice of beverages. This beverage product became available at Golden Corral a year later. In 2017, both Taco Bell and Golden Corral removed Manzanita Sol from their choice of beverages.\"Manzanita Sol\" is Spanish for \"little apple sun\".",

During its early years, Mason's Root Beer and flavors line were widely distributed in the Midwest as well as some Southern states.In 1970, the Rheingold Corporation entered the soda pop business with the purchase of Grapette, changing the company's name to Flavette. The Flavette division subsequently purchased the Dr. Wells soda pop brand and Mason & Mason, Inc. In 1975, Rheingold and its Flavette division were purchased by PepsiCo, Inc. in a hostile takeover. The Federal Trade Commission felt that PepsiCo owned too many brands and forced it to divest several of its brands. By 1978, Mason's Root Beer had been acquired by Monarch Beverage Company but was mostly shelved in favor of the higher-volume Dad's brand of root beer, which Monarch acquired in 1986.",

The taste of Polo-Cockta is sometimes described as a mixture of Coca-Cola and Pepsi.\nFor a while Polo-Cockta was renamed Polo Cola, without change to the product. However, in 2016, Polo Cola was renamed back to Polo-Cockta.\nPolo-Cockta has made a significant appearance in the Polish film Kingsajz by Juliusz Machulski, where it was a major plot device.",

It is produced by Sinalco International, a company headquartered in Detmold, Germany.\nIn 1902, German scientist Friedrich Eduard Bilz invented \"Bilz Brause\", a sherbet powder, and started to sell it in partnership with industrialist Franz Hartmann. As imitations started to appear, they held a prize competition for a brand name, and chose \"Sinalco\" (an abbreviation of the Latin sine alcohole, \"without alcohol\"). As one of the first beverage brands, Sinalco came to be exported worldwide, particularly to South America and the Middle East. The red circle trademark was registered in 1937. A distinctively-shaped bottle was launched in the 1950s, and updated at the end of the century. Besides the original Sinalco Orange, today the company also bottles Sinalco Cola and a few other kinds of soft drinks. In Germany, it is the third most popular soft drink, after Fanta and Sprite.In Slovenia Sinalco soft drinks are produced by food tech company Dana, licensed by Sinalco International GmbH & Co.",

        "summary": "Socat\u0103 or suc de soc is a traditional Romanian soft drink made from the flowers of the European elder (or elderberry) shrub, Sambucus nigra (soc in Romanian). It may be non-alcoholic or, usually, low-alcoholic, and can be carbonated or non-carbonated, depending on the fermentation type and duration. It is produced by the natural fermentation of elder flowers in a lemon and sugar or (traditionally) honey solution. Raisins, lemon or lime slices and various spices (mint, lemon or orange zest, basil leaves) may be added. Some newer variations substitute raisins or dates for sugar or honey, and limes instead of lemons as well as additional spices such as saffron or ginger may be used. Yeast and/or rice grains can be added to intensify alcoholic fermentation, if desired. \nSocat\u0103 is popular throughout Southeast Europe, where it is also known as fermentirana zova (in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro and gemi\u0161t od bazge in Croatia and Slovenia).\nSocata can be prepared early summer using freshly cut flowers, or throughout the year, from dried flowers. \nThe elder flowers, water and lemon mix may be steeped for a day, then the other ingredients are added. Primary fermentation takes 2-4 days in a covered but not airtight recipient. After this stage,  the drink is filtered, transferred in smaller bottles, refrigerated and consumed usually within 1-2 days as a very low alcohol or non-alcoholic soft drink. Often, home-made Socata is prepared in 10 L batches to be consumed right  after primary fermentation, with family or friends, for holidays, weekends or casual events such as birthdays or barbecues.\nIf left for longer in bottles, the secondary fermentation will increase the alcohol and carbon dioxide levels to levels comparable to those found in beer. In this case, the drink might become too carbonated if the bottles are completely closed (airtight).\nIn traditional Romanian medicine, elder flowers are thought to have detoxifying, diuretic, expectorant, immunostimulant and anti-infectious properties and were used as infusion to help treatment of respiratory and urinary disorders. The European elderberry (sometimes called common elder) also grows spontaneously in North America.\nIn Sweden, Switzerland, Romania, Albania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia, Ukraine, Poland, India, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Iceland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Russia, and some other countries, there is \"Fanta Shokata\" based on the Socat\u0103.",

The product, sold in a brown bottle or can, is made and distributed by The Coca-Cola Company.As is common with ginger beers in comparison to the lighter ginger ales, the ginger flavour present in Stoney is especially intense. There are several varieties of Stoney in different parts of Africa. In South Africa there are three different stoneys, extra kwetsa, regular and sugar free and javaman kwetsa. Although they are all bottled by Coca-Cola, their recipes vary: the versions in Southern Africa tend to be more carbonated and sweeter, while the East Africa version tends to have a much stronger ginger taste. Stoney Ginger Beer was introduced in South Africa in 1971.\n\n\n== References ==",

Before the First World War, Lagidze repeatedly received gold medals at international exhibitions for his water.

Wintergreen soda may have originally been a homemade foodstuff but was ultimately one of the many flavors listed in the catalogs of flavoring companies serving late 19th-century soda fountain proprietors.Carrie Giddings, a Civil War-era U.S. Army wife, relied on homemade lemon and wintergreen soda waters when she was called upon to host important guests. American nature writer Edwin Way Teale recalled it as a favorite of his childhood in Indiana: \"From early days wintergreen was a flavor that gave me my greatest delight. At the ornate Canditorium, on Main Street in Michigan City, I used to reach a seventh heaven and enter in when a wintergreen soda, with coral-pink foam, was set before me.\"",

Brio is known to be a sweeter variant.Brio was created by three Italian immigrants in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in 1959\u2014Elio Madonia, who immigrated to Canada in 1950 from Corleone, Sicily, and his partners Giuseppe Panacci and Angelo Pirrello that he had met during his time as an insurance salesman. Panacci and Pirrello had met as competing door-to-door salesmen for Punch Dry and New Jersey brand colas. The three partners created a number of beverages, including Mio, a lemon-lime gazzosa, and Brio, and purchased a used bottling line in downtown Toronto for $4,500 in 1959. The company moved to North York in the mid 1960s.The chinotto extract is imported from Italy, but bottled in Canada by National Dry Beverages, previously known as Mio Manufacturing, established by the three partners. It has become a popular beverage in Ontario, particularly among Italian immigrants, serving as a marker of identity for the Italian emigrant population in Canada. Brio is a slightly less bitter drink than the chinotto on which it is based.In April 2018, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario launched an alcoholic version of Brio mixed with vodka.The graphic design of the bottle has remained similar to the original mid-century design, using red and green lowercase sans-serif type on a white background reminiscent of the Flag of Italy.",

All McDaid's products were originally made and bottled at the Swilly Bottling Stores in Ramelton in North Donegal.

Some McDaid's products, including Football Special, are also manufactured under license by the Reading Soda Works in Reading, Pennsylvania.The original factory in Ramelton was formerly a creamery. Football Special is one of McDaid's oldest and most distinguished products, winning two awards for excellence in 1984 and 1989 from the London Beverage Society.Edward McDaid, the CEO of the company, was also on the founding board of Swilly Rovers FC, twice winners of the FAI Junior Cup, and, as such, wanted to celebrate winning trophies by filling the cup with a non-alcoholic beverage. They created a drink which has a beer-like foamy head and named it 'Football Cup', which later was changed to Football Special.The footballer illustrated on the labelling of the bottles since 2015 is a stylised version of local Milford Utd footballer Kevin Moran. \nFootball Special is found most commonly on sale throughout County Donegal, where it was originally produced and it is often considered \"The best drink in Ireland\" by those who consume it. However, it is also widely on sale in neighbouring areas, such as in Derry and in Strabane and other places in the west of County Tyrone. It is also sold in Tesco in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh. Football Special is on sale in some shops in Belfast. It is usually sold in plastic bottles. Recently, Football Special was used to make Football Special-flavoured cheesecakes, which were sold in SuperValu in Newtowncunningham and Ballybofey. Football Special is also sold in some shops in Glasgow, and has been on sale since 2019 in some shops in Cambridge.\nThe brand was the main sponsor of the Foyle Cup in 2011.",

        "summary": "MiWadi is an Irish soft drink brand owned by Britvic, and formerly by Cantrell and Cochrane (C&C), bottled in Dublin, Cork and Belfast.\nIts name comes from the initial letters of C&C's predecessor company, Mineral Water Distributors, which was formed in 1927. The range includes blackcurrant, lemon, lime, and orange & pineapple fruit squashes, with additional flavours produced on a seasonal basis, such as peppermint, and clove.\nThe slogan of MiWadi is \"It's not your Wadi, it's MiWadi\", seen on MiWadi bottles and commercials.  The drink suffered declining sales during the 1990s, occupying only 16.4% of the market share by 1995, but it experienced a sales renaissance in the 21st century and as of 2005 it accounted for 37% of fruit squash sold in the Irish market.",

        "summary": "Mitsuya Cider (\u4e09\u30c4\u77e2\u30b5\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc, Mitsuya Said\u0101) is a Japanese carbonated soft drink, created in 1884 and acquired by Asahi Soft Drinks in 1972.While branded as a \"cider\", the East Asian use of \"cider\" refers to a very different drink from that typically referred to in English: the basic flavor can be described as a cross between a lemon-lime drink and Ginger Ale, though Asahi has come out with additional flavors, including grape, lemon, mikan and white peach.  Occasionally, Mitsuya Cider will release its \"White Cider\" version with its own variations, which include \"White Cider with Melon\". In 2020, Asahi re-released a Showa-era flavor, \"Lemola\" for a limited time (still available in mid-2022). Lemola is a lemon-lime flavor. \nMitsuya Cider used to be sold exclusively in ornately decorated metal bottles, but is now produced primarily in plastic.  The old style metal bottles are still available in many vending machines and convenience stores for customers who prefer the nostalgic packaging.\nAlso on the market are small hard candies marked with the same logo as the cider bottles, and a carbonation effect. The candy is made by mixing its ingredients and heating them until they melt, then exposing the mixture to pressurized carbon dioxide gas (about 600 pounds per square inch) and allowing it to cool.  The process causes tiny high pressure bubbles to be trapped inside the candy.  When placed in the mouth, coming into contact with saliva the candy breaks and dissolves, releasing the carbon dioxide from the tiny bubbles, resulting in a popping and sizzling sound and leaving a slight tingling sensation. The bubbles in the candy pieces can be viewed when aided by a microscope.\nMitsuya Cider gained exposure in the West during 2008 as a result of the Rickrolling internet meme, since Rick Astley was the face of the brand during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Rick Astley was featured in some of its TV commercials in Japan during the late 80s.",

It competes with Unilever/PepsiCo's Lipton Iced Tea and Fuze Tea. Nestea provides a variety of tea products, including liquid and powdered tea concentrates, refrigeratable teas, and ready-to-drink bottles dispensed by vendor or vending machine.  The beverage comes in several flavors, depending on the country.\nSince the start of 2017, Nestl\u00e9 and Coca-Cola agreed to end the iced tea Nestea joint venture after 16 years of collaboration. One of the reasons for this, is that Coca-Cola and Nestl\u00e9 want to pursue different strategies in a rapidly changing market. Nestl\u00e9 will handle the distribution of Nestea in most countries except in Canada, Spain, Portugal, Romania, Andorra, Bulgaria and Serbia where Coca-Cola will retain a license.In 2019, Nestea rebranded as a natural product. The new recipe, launched by Nestl\u00e9 after the end of the joint venture, does not contain artificial colors and flavors, corn syrup or GMO ingredients anymore. In addition, Nestea ready-to-drink iced tea is made with stevia extract and can be found in different flavors such as lemon, raspberry and peach. The new recipe sources its tea leaves from Nilgiri, Sri Lanka, Kenya and Indonesia.",

It was introduced in test markets around May 1996, then went to most markets by 1997, and then quickly disappeared due to poor sales. The drink was sold in six flavors, and made with small floating edible balls. Orbitz was marketed as a \"texturally enhanced alternative beverage\" but some consumers compared it to a portable lava lamp.The small balls floated due to their nearly equal density to the surrounding liquid, and remained suspended with the assistance of gellan gum.  The gellan gum provided a support matrix and had a visual clarity approaching that of water, which increased with the addition of sugar. The gellan gum created a very weak yield stress which has been measured to be ~0.04 Pa.\nThe product's domain name was bought by the Internet-based travel agency named Orbitz.\nUnopened bottles from the drink's original launch have become a collector's item, appearing on online auction websites.\nThe Clearly Food & Beverage Company states that the proprietary equipment that made Orbitz broke down and the trademark is no longer owned by the company. In July 2013, Clearly Canadian stated that it was considering producing a limited run of new products to satisfy \"nostalgia demand\", with the possibility of annual issues thereafter based on consumer reception of the initial batch.",

It vanished from UK shelves in 1988, together with the apple based Cydrax, suffering from plummeting sales.Sales of the beverage continued in Trinidad and Tobago to the point that \"Trinidadians and Tobagonians now see the drink as a defining part of the culture of their twin-island republic.\" Until December 2017, it was manufactured and bottled by Pepsi-Cola Trinidad Bottling Company (part of PepsiAmericas Caribbean Operations), before both the Peardrax and Cydrax brands were bought up by Caribbean Distribution Partners, a joint venture of Trinidad-based Agostini's Ltd. and Barbados-based Goddard Enterprises.",

All three are lemon-flavoured, but there is a marked difference in taste between the varieties. Red lemonade is particularly associated with festive occasions, but can also be a folk remedy.Red lemonade is drunk on its own and is also served as a mixer with spirits in Ireland, particularly in whiskey. Major brands of red lemonade include TK (formerly Taylor Keith), Country Spring, Finches, Nash's, Maine, and C&C. There was an urban myth that European Union authorities had banned red lemonade, but in fact the authorities had simply banned a cancer-causing dye.",

        "summary": "Ribena ( rye-BEE-n\u0259) is a brand of blackcurrant-based soft drink (both uncarbonated and carbonated), and fruit drink concentrate designed to be mixed with water. It is available in bottles, cans and multi-packs. Originally of English origin,  it was produced by the pharmaceutical company  GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) until 2013, when the brand was sold to Japanese beverage conglomerate Suntory.\nThe brand originally had a strong reputation as a healthy product for children, stemming from its distribution to children  as a vitamin C supplement during World War II by the British government. Beecham, a company that has been part of GSK since 2000, bought the brand in 1955 and developed many soft drink versions. A series of scandals in the 2000s, concerning vitamin C levels, sugar levels, and the amounts of actual fruit in some of the brands, damaged its reputation as a healthy product, and by 2013, the brand was widely regarded as a soft drink.In 2013, annual worldwide sales were around \u00a3500 million. That year, GSK sold Ribena and another consumer line, Lucozade, to the Japanese multinational Suntory for \u00a31.35 billion. In April 2018, in the United Kingdom, Ribena's longstanding recipe was changed by the addition of artificial sweeteners in response to the introduction of a sugary drinks tax by the UK government.",

In April 1983, Sundor Brands bought out Doric Foods; Sundor Brands was then purchased by American multinational Procter & Gamble in March 1989. The drink is superficially related to orange juice, but also resembles a soft drink without carbonation. \nThe drink produced an estimated $450 million in revenue for Procter & Gamble in 2004. In 2005, Sunny Delight was spun off into the independent Sunny Delight Beverages Company (SDBC). The beverage is also distributed by Dr Pepper/Seven Up (DPSU). In Canada, the drink is manufactured and distributed by Saputo.\nThe beverage was launched in the United Kingdom in April 1998 with a \u00a310 million promotional campaign, and by August 1999, it became the third biggest selling drink in the United Kingdom, behind Coca-Cola and Pepsi. \nIt was sold in refrigerated cabinets, and marketed as a healthier alternative to soft drinks despite neither being healthier nor requiring refrigeration. Despite the name, SunnyD is not a high source of vitamin D, nor has it ever claimed to be; however, it contains significant amounts of vitamin C.SunnyD started out with only one flavor: orange. Now it comes in multiple flavors: Tangy Original, Smooth Orange, Orange Strawberry, Orange Mango, Orange Peach, Watermelon, Fruit Punch, Peach, Mango, Blue Raspberry, Cherry Limeade, Lemonade, and Orange Pineapple.",

The sale was preceded by an announcement in late 1988 by Seagram that it had decided to sell the brand.The Nikolai brand is available in 80, 90, and 100 proof bottlings. \nIt's bottled in Frankfort, Kentucky. A young lad from Montana known as \"Nikolai Novak\" became the poster child for the brand, often pictured enjoying spirits with his university mates.\nThe Nikolai brand has been marketed primarily as a value-oriented brand, advertised as being priced very reasonably while tasting like more expensive vodka. The brand web site says that the brand is produced using a unique proprietary distillation technique and a special recipe to yield low congener vodka, and that the Sazerac Company has been faithfully adhering to Seagram's original formula for its production process. The Sazerac Company classifies its vodka brand offerings into three categories: \"super premium\", \"premium\", and \"standard\".  Nikolai is classified in the \"standard\" brand category.Spirit reviewer Bob Emmons has described Nikolai 80 proof as having \"few flavors other than alcohol and a light burn\".\n\n\n== References ==",

For many Swedes it is unknown though.Svedka was acquired by Constellation Brands in March 2007 for US$384 million.They made some \"spooky internet advertisements\" for Halloween in 2017. This led to many customers feeling uneasy and was ultimately an unsuccessful marketing campaign.Svedka Vodka was in 2008 described as \"fast growing\", as it added a new flavor, \"Citron\", Swedish for lemon.The Swedish National Food Agency claims that it may not be distributed as Swedish vodka because \"Swedish vodka\" is a protected designation according to EU rules, and thus must meet certain requirements. The Swedish National Food Agency believes that Lantm\u00e4nnen violates some of these requirements when the company transports the concentrated 96 percent alcohol to the United States to be diluted with water there.",

It was originally a celebration of harvest, made following the raspberry harvest in August. The dessert of cream and fresh seasonal raspberries is bolstered by Scottish oats and whisky. It has been called 'the uncontested king of Scottish desserts'. Cranachan owes its origins to crowdie, a popular breakfast in which crowdie cheese is combined with lightly toasted oatmeal, cream, and local honey. Raspberries, when in season, might be added to the dish.\nCranachan is now served all year round, and typically on special occasions. A traditional way to serve cranachan is to bring dishes of each ingredient to the table so that each person can assemble their own dessert to taste.",

The rest of the mix is a neutral spirit distilled from molasses. (It's much easier and cheaper to grow sugar cane than barley in India.) That means that, strictly speaking, Royal Challenge, like most Indian \"whisky\", is actually a rum flavored to pass as whisky.\" The manufacturer has refused to state the percentage of Scotch whisky used in the blend.
